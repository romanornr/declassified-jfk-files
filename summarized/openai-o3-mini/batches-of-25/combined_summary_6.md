## Key Themes and Findings

### Surveillance and Espionage Operations
- A significant focus of the documents is on individuals tied to covert operations and the status of agents under various projects, notably the LIENVOY and LIFEAT projects, which were aimed at monitoring and influencing political dynamics in Mexico and beyond.
