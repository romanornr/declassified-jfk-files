# Unveiling CIA Secrets: A Synthesis of Classified Documents

This summary consolidates information from a series of classified CIA documents, offering insights into various agency operations, personnel, and relationships with external organizations. The documents span from the late 1950s to the late 1960s, a period marked by heightened Cold War tensions and increased covert activities. Key themes include personnel security, cover operations, and the use of foundations as funding mechanisms.

## Daniel Flores: Personal History Statements

The documents include multiple "Supplemental Personal History Statements" (PHS) for Daniel Flores. These statements provide a glimpse into his background, family, and international experiences:

*   **Personal Information:** Born on 04 Aug 1935 in San Marcos, Texas, Flores is married to Dorothy Arnett Flores (born 31 Jan 1935 in Portland, Oregon) and has two daughters, Kendra (born 3 March 1971 in Washington, D.C.) and Zola Marie (born 15 March 1974 in Washington, D.C.).
*   **Residences:** Flores lived in Guayaquil, Ecuador (May 1969 - May 1971) and Lima, Peru (Sept. 1971 - Feb. 1974) before residing in Vienna, Virginia (from Feb. 1974).
*   **Family Connections:** Flores' nephew, Richard Guerrero, was employed by the U.S. Army and stationed in Ansbach, Germany, as of March 1974.
*   **Employment & Skills:** Flores indicated that he could act as a literal interpreter. He was also willing to use his language ability in any position for which he might be selected.

These PHS documents offer insight into the types of information the CIA collected on its employees, including family connections, residences, and language skills.

## Project DILAMPREY and the Vernon Fund: Covert Funding of Educational Organizations

Several documents detail the CIA's use of the Vernon Fund as a cover and funding mechanism for Project DILAMPREY, aimed at strengthening non-Communist teachers' organizations worldwide:

*   **Vernon Fund:** Created in June 1958, the Vernon Fund (HEMUDWEED) was an ostensibly private philanthropic foundation used to support the International programs of the National Education Association (FBLINTERN) and the World Confederation of Organizations of the Teaching Profession (JELACEPOD).
*   **Damage Control:** In March 1967, after the Vernon Fund's exposure in the news media, board members were advised on how to respond to inquiries, including acknowledging their membership and declining further comment on the fund's origin or operation.
*   **Key Individuals:**
    *   Albert Blake DICK, III (President, A. B. DICK Company) was granted a Covert Security Approval for his witting use in connection with the funding of Project DILAMPREY.
    *   William George CARR (Secretary-General of the World Confederation of Organizations in the Teaching Profession) received Covert Security Clearances for unwitting use under Project DIPLOMAT and Project DILAMPREY.
    *   Bryce REA, Jr. (attorney for the Vernon Fund) was granted Covert Security Clearances for use as a Leases Cut-Out and on a cleared attorneys' panel.
*   **WCOTP Funding:** In April 1967, discussions were held with John THOMPSON and Ray GEMS of the WCOTP regarding future funding. The WCOTP leadership promised its membership that no further Vernon Fund money would be accepted until the status of the Vernon Fund was clarified.

This series of documents exposes the CIA's covert funding of educational organizations to promote its Cold War agenda, and the measures taken to contain the fallout when these activities were exposed.

## BROWN and ROOT, Inc.: Corporate Connections

These documents reveal the CIA's relationship with the construction company BROWN and ROOT, Inc.:

*   **Employees Approved for Contact Use:** Several employees were approved for contact use, starting as early as March 1950.
*   **Key Employees:**
    *   Rosa Hette (approved 13 March 1950)
    *   Isaac Newton Tonne (Vice-President) (approved 11 December 1952)
    *   Merritt Allen Warner (Chief Project Accountant) (approved 31 January 1957)
    *   George Rufus BROWN (Executive Vice President) was granted a Covert Security Clearance for use as a covert associate and later for possible use on the Board of Directors for a proprietary in Udorn, Thailand, Laos.
    *   Herman BROWN (President and Director) was granted a Covert Security Approval for use as a Covert Associate.
*   **BROWN Foundation:** The BROWN Foundation of Houston, Texas, was identified as vulnerable to exposure due to direct ties from Agency funding instruments.

These documents highlight the CIA's strategic partnerships with private corporations like BROWN and ROOT, Inc., and the use of foundations to obscure funding sources.

## American Friends of the Middle East: Propaganda and Influence

The documents discuss the American Friends of the Middle East (AFME) and its role in promoting a pro-U.S. sentiment in the Middle East:

*   **Project ERTADER:** Created in May 1951, AFME aimed to combat Communism through aggressive propaganda and promote friendship between the peoples of the Near and Middle East and the United States.
*   **Publicity and Controversy:** In early 1967, AFME faced significant newspaper publicity concerning its Agency affiliation, including articles in the Soviet press.

This reveals the CIA's involvement in shaping public opinion and political sentiment in strategically important regions through organizations like AFME.

## Herbert Itkin/Mario Brod et al.: Investigation of Alleged CIA Ties

These documents detail an investigation into Herbert Itkin's claims of having worked with the CIA in the 1950s:

*   **Itkin's Claims:** Itkin claimed to have provided information to Senator Joseph McCarthy, met with Allen Dulles, and worked with a man named Philip Harbin. He also stated that he was able to report on matters affecting U Nu, then the Premier of Burma, the Indonesian Foreign Minister, and the owner or editor of the New Delhi Times. Itkin also claimed to have had personal contacts with Luis Gutierrez, Consul General of El Salvador, and with a number of other people who had Guatemalan contacts.
*   **Agency Records:** Agency files reflected no record of Herbert Itkin, Philip Harbin, or any association between Mario Brod and Philip Harbin.
*   **Thomas L. Roberts:** Itkin mentioned that a lawyer from his former law firm, Thomas L. Roberts, had useful contacts with the United Nations. Roberts was found to be a current Agency employee under deep cover in Dakar.
*   **Dulles Interview Recommendation**: Because of the possibility of an extreme flap, it was recommended that, with the concurrence of Mr. Helms, Mr. Dulles be interviewed and asked if he remembers anything about this case.

This investigation exemplifies the CIA's efforts to verify or debunk claims of association with the agency, particularly when those claims could potentially expose covert operations.

## Other Operations and Personnel

The documents also touch on various other operations, personnel, and entities:

*   **Peter Paul Gregory:** Subject of an investigation, with the possibility of using (DODD) or (CFTCODE) credentials.
*   **Henry P. Lopez:** An asset of Station Mexico City from 1961 to August 1966, traveling extensively throughout Central and Latin America for sponsored operational activity.
*   **John F. Rittenhouse:** Security concurrence was requested for the conversion of Rittenhouse's status from OPC Staff Employee to OPC Staff Agent, to be assigned to Mexico City under State Department deep cover.
*   **Calvin W. Hicks:** Official cover backstopping was established for Calvin W. Hicks, utilizing the (U. S. Army Staff Group) 32
*   **Aline MOSBY and Priscilla JOHNSON:** Information was furnished regarding Aline MOSBY, a newspaperman in SCHAPIRO office, and Priscilla JOHNSON, another nowspaperwomen in Moscow. It was stated that it was highly possible the Soviets had attempted to recruit JOHNSON.

These snippets provide a broader view of the CIA's diverse operations and the range of individuals involved.

## Conclusion

These documents offer a multi-faceted view of the CIA's operations during the Cold War era. They illustrate the agency's reliance on covert funding mechanisms, strategic partnerships with private corporations, and propaganda efforts to advance its geopolitical objectives. The documents also highlight the meticulousness of personnel security procedures and the agency's efforts to manage and contain potential exposures. The overall narrative underscores the CIA's proactive role in shaping global events through a complex web of covert activities, strategic alliances, and information control.

## Summary for Someone Who Has Never Read the JFK Files

Okay, imagine these documents are pieces of a puzzle about the CIA during the Cold War (late 1950s to late 1960s), a time when the US and Soviet Union were competing for global power.

The puzzle shows us a few key things:

*   **People's Background Checks:** The CIA kept very detailed records about its employees, like Daniel Flores. These records included where they lived, who their family was, and what languages they spoke.  This was to make sure employees were trustworthy and wouldn't be a security risk.
*   **Secret Money for Good Causes (Sort Of):** The CIA sometimes used fake foundations, like the "Vernon Fund," to secretly fund organizations. In this case, the Vernon Fund was used to give money to teacher groups to promote non-communist ideas around the world. The idea was to fight communism by influencing education, but they kept the CIA's involvement secret.
*   **Business Partners:** The CIA worked with big companies like BROWN and ROOT, Inc.  These companies were used for various purposes, likely including providing cover for agents or helping with construction projects in sensitive areas.
*   **Spreading the American Message:** The CIA also tried to influence public opinion in other countries. They used groups like the "American Friends of the Middle East" to spread positive messages about the US and counter communist ideas.
*   **Checking Out Claims:** Sometimes people claimed to have worked with the CIA. The agency would investigate these claims, as they did with a man named Herbert Itkin, to make sure they were true and to protect any secret operations.

Basically, these documents give us a peek into how the CIA operated in secret during the Cold War. They were involved in a lot more than just spying; they were trying to influence events around the world through money, propaganda, and secret partnerships. They also invested in maintaining secrecy about those activities and partners.

It is important to remember, this is only one part of the picture. These documents don't give us the whole story, but they help us understand the CIA's role during a very important time in history.
