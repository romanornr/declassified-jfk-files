# Unraveling CIA Operations: Covert Activities, Cuban Intelligence, and Mercenary Networks

This summary consolidates information from several classified CIA documents, revealing a complex web of covert operations, intelligence gathering on Cuban officials, and the activities of international mercenaries during the Cold War era. The documents span from 1959 to 1970 and touch upon sensitive topics such as potential DRE (Student Revolutionary Directorate) animus toward President Kennedy, efforts to approach Cuban targets, and the management of assets and informants for intelligence purposes.

## Establishing Covert Operations and Asset Management

The CIA utilized elaborate cover stories to maintain the secrecy of its operations and protect its assets.

*   **Roberts Electronic and Engineering Service:** As documented on October 19, 1961, the CIA established a cover firm named Roberts Electronic and Engineering Service in Baltimore, Maryland, to provide employment and credit references for a "Subject." This individual was to be presented as a consultant in the southeastern United States, receiving payments via bank transfers.
*   **Tax Implications:** The Subject was to file an overt tax return as an independent contractor with Roberts, explaining why taxes were not withheld, ensuring that the cover remained consistent with public records.
*   **Importance of Non-Official Cover:** These measures highlight the CIA's emphasis on creating believable and verifiable backgrounds for its operatives, allowing them to operate without raising suspicion.
*   **AMWHIP:** Another instance of creating a cover involves an individual named AMWHIP/1, a long time KUBARK asset who was opening a jewelry store in Rome and offering services to the Rome station, including cover. (June 5, 1963)

## Targeting Cuban Intelligence and Officials

A significant portion of the documents focuses on identifying, monitoring, and potentially approaching Cuban intelligence officials.

*   **Manuel (Vigos) Perez:** In May 1970, the CIA sought to determine the biographical details and occupation of Manuel (Vigos) Perez, residing in Los Angeles, who had moved from Miami. Perez was a cousin of AMAUTO-1, a high-profile Cuban target.
*   **Approach to AMAUTO-1:** A plan was devised to arrange a "chance encounter" between an agent named SAMKO and AMAUTO-1 in Madrid, Spain. The approach involved SAMKO traveling to Madrid, staying at a hotel under an alias, and visiting AMAUTO-1's residence with a fabricated story to gain access.
*   **Contingency Planning:** The CIA meticulously planned for possible questions AMAUTO-1 might ask, preparing SAMKO with rehearsed replies. This included addressing how SAMKO obtained AMAUTO-1's address and knowledge of his presence in Madrid.
*   **Monitoring and Surveillance:** The approach to AMAUTO-1's residence was to be monitored by CIA staffers living nearby.
*   **Cuban Embassy Protests in Spain:** In early May 1970, the Cuban Embassy in Madrid protested alleged attacks on Cuban officials by Cuban refugees at Barajas Airport. The Cuban Consul in Madrid claimed that the CIA and "counterrevolutionaries" orchestrated the scene.
*   **Cuban Security Measures:** The documents also indicate that Cuban officials in Spain were seeking permission to carry firearms for self-defense, highlighting the escalating tensions and security concerns.
*   **Identified and Suspect Cuban Intelligence Officers:** A list compiled from SMOTE records, dated December 28, 1962, identified individuals as Cuban intelligence officers, providing brief descriptions and their known activities.

## Unveiling Mercenary Activities and Networks

The documents shed light on the CIA's interest in mercenary activities, particularly those involving Alastair Wicks, a key figure in mercenary recruitment and operations.

*   **Alastair Wicks:** Wicks, identified as a mercenary with Rhodesian citizenship, was involved in various plots and recruitment efforts. In 1961, he was a mercenary in the Katanga gendarme. He later served as the second-in-command to Michael Hoare in the Congo in 1964, and by December 1965, he resigned from 5th Commando in Congo and went to Johannesburg to act as a mercenary recruiting officer in South Africa. He was also involved in a July 1966 plot to overthrow Mobutu.
*   **Recruitment and Operations:** Wicks was known for recruiting mercenaries for Tshombe's forces in the Congo and was later involved in plans to overthrow the Congolese government. He had connections to Air Trans Africa, using it for mercenary flights.
*   **Yemen Connection:** In March 1967, Michael Hoare received a letter from Wicks in London, offering him a job potentially related to mercenary recruitment for service in Yemen.
*   **Monitoring Wicks' Activities:** The CIA tracked Wicks' movements and contacts, including his association with Jack Malloch and his involvement in the Biafran airlift.

## DRE Animus Towards President Kennedy

One document raises concerns about the potential animosity of the DRE leadership towards President Kennedy.

*   **Luis Fernandez Rocha:** Calvin Thomas, a former JMWAVE operative, recalled that the DRE leadership, particularly Luis Fernandez Rocha, harbored resentment towards President Kennedy for not pursuing the "liberation" of Cuba more forcefully.
*   **Potential for Revenge:** Thomas expressed concern that this animus might have translated into a desire for revenge, though he acknowledged that officers with more recent involvement with the DRE would have better knowledge of this.
*   **Connection to Oswald:** The document highlights the DRE's connection to investigations into President Kennedy's assassination, noting that the DRE's New Orleans representative was said to have had contacts with Lee Harvey Oswald.

## Concluding Insights and Implications

These CIA documents offer a glimpse into the multifaceted nature of Cold War-era intelligence operations. The agency was deeply involved in:

*   **Covert Operations:** Creating elaborate cover stories and using front companies to protect assets and maintain secrecy.
*   **Intelligence Gathering:** Closely monitoring Cuban officials and attempting to recruit individuals who could provide valuable information.
*   **Mercenary Activities:** Tracking the activities of international mercenaries and their involvement in various conflicts.
*   **Political Considerations:** Assessing the political sentiments of various groups and their potential impact on U.S. interests, including the DRE's potential animus towards President Kennedy.

The documents underscore the complex interplay of intelligence, politics, and covert action during this period, highlighting the lengths to which the CIA went to gather information, influence events, and protect its interests.

## Making it Understandable for Readers Unfamiliar with the JFK Files

Okay, here's a breakdown designed to make this information accessible even if you've never seen a JFK document before:

**Imagine this like a spy thriller, but based on real CIA records.** These documents are snippets of that story, giving us a glimpse into what the CIA was doing behind the scenes during the Cold War, particularly regarding Cuba and some shady characters involved in global conflicts.

**The Big Picture:**

*   **The Cold War Context:** Remember, this was a time of intense rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union. Cuba, being a communist country close to the US, was a major point of concern. The CIA was actively trying to gather information, destabilize the Cuban government, and protect US interests.
*   **The JFK Assassination Connection:** Some of these documents are relevant because they touch on individuals or groups that were later investigated in connection with President Kennedy's assassination. The CIA was trying to figure out if there was any possibility of any of their operations having anything to do with the assassination.

**Key Players & Activities:**

1.  **Creating Fake Backgrounds (Covert Operations):**

    *   The CIA often needed to create fake jobs and backgrounds for their agents. One document describes setting up a fake company called "Roberts Electronic and Engineering Service" to employ a secret agent and give him a cover story. This helped keep their real activities hidden.
2.  **Watching Cuban Officials (Intelligence Gathering):**

    *   The CIA was very interested in knowing what Cuban officials were doing, especially those working in other countries. They were trying to find ways to get close to them, gather information, and possibly recruit them to work for the US.
    *   One document talks about a plan to have an agent meet a Cuban official ("AMAUTO-1") in Madrid, Spain. The plan was elaborate, including fake stories to explain the agent's presence and monitoring the meeting.
3.  **Dealing with Mercenaries (Shady World):**

    *   The documents mention a guy named Alastair Wicks, who was a mercenary. Mercenaries are basically soldiers for hire. Wicks was involved in conflicts in Africa and possibly Yemen.
    *   The CIA was tracking Wicks and his activities, likely because they wanted to know who he was working for and what he was up to.
4.  **The "DRE" and JFK (Possible Motives?):**

    *   The "DRE" was a group of Cuban students who opposed Fidel Castro's government. Some members of the DRE were investigated in connection to the Kennedy assassination.
    *   One document mentions that the DRE leadership was angry with President Kennedy because they felt he wasn't doing enough to overthrow Castro. This raises the question of whether this anger could have motivated them to do something drastic.

**Why These Documents Matter:**

*   **Insights into CIA Methods:** These documents give us a rare look at how the CIA operated during the Cold War. They show the complex and often secretive methods they used to gather information and influence events.
*   **Historical Context:** Understanding these activities helps us understand the political climate of the time and the lengths to which the US government was willing to go to counter communism.
*   **JFK Assassination Connection:** While these documents don't provide a smoking gun, they do shed light on individuals and groups that were of interest to investigators looking into the Kennedy assassination.

**In simple terms, imagine the CIA as a detective agency operating on a global scale, trying to solve a very complex case (the Cold War). These documents are like pieces of evidence that help us understand the case, the players involved, and the methods used.**
