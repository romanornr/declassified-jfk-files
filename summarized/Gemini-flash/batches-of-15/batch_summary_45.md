# AMLASH: Covert Operations and Cuban Intelligence

This summary compiles information from a collection of classified CIA documents spanning from 1961 to 1968, with some later references, focusing on covert operations related to Cuba, key individuals involved, and the political climate of the time. The documents revolve around various operations, primarily focusing on a Cuban agent codenamed AMLASH, and related intelligence gathering and counter-intelligence efforts.

## AMLASH and Paris Station Involvement (1962-1965)

*   **Initial Contact (1962):** AMLASH/1 first came to the attention of the Paris Station in 1962 after attending the Helsinki Youth Festival, where he was "contested" by UNRUMELE and other KUBARK assets. It is unclear when AMLASH/1 was formally recruited, but it likely occurred during or shortly after the festival.
*   **Training and Activities in Paris:** In Paris, AMLASH/1 interacted with Peter J. KIMINGHAM and received explosives training from OHMX upon the Paris Station's request. He returned to PBRUM (possibly a code name for Cuba) in late 1962.
*   **Return to Paris (September 1963):** AMLASH/1 arrived in Paris again in September 1963, following the International Games in Porto Alegre, Brazil, where he had contact with TYPIC officers. AMFORT/L (later QUEPORT) and AM/HIP/1 were also in contact with AMLASH/1 at this time.
*   **Meetings and Discussions:** Headquarters TYPIC officer, ONTRICH, arrived in Paris in October 1963 and took over contact with AMLASH/1. Discussions focused on AMLASH/1's plan to assassinate AMPED and overthrow his regime.
*   **Seeking ODYOKE Blessing:** In late October or early November, ONTRICH and DAIHOID met with AMLASH/1 to discuss his plans and seek ODYOKE blessing. DAIHOID, a high-level ODYOKE official, participated due to AMLASH/1's strong desire for ODYOKE's support. The impression, according to KYMMOHAN, was that such blessing was given.
*   **STOCKFOOD and KUBARK:** Before AMLASH/1 returned to PBRUM in November 1963, he met STOCKFOOD, likely in alias, and it became clear that AMLASH/1 was also working for KUBARK. STOCKFOOD was aware of AMLASH/1's plans to some extent.
*   **Further Activities in Paris (1964-1965):** AMLASH/1 returned to Paris in late November or early December 1964. He met with AMSHIP/1, STOCKWOOD, and ONTRICH. He traveled from Madrid to PERUMEN in February 1965. During his stay in Paris, he met with KUBARK staffers and agents, including STOCKWOOD, CLOADER, RODAMOR, AWHIP/L, UNSHAFU/5, and UNSHAFU/13.
*   **UNSHAFU/5's Breakdown:** In December 1964, UNSHAFU/5 had a nervous breakdown, and AMLASH/1 played a significant role in convincing him to agree to hospitalization. CLOADER and RODANER met AMLASH/1 in this context.
*   **Meetings in Madrid:** AMLASH/1 traveled to Madrid at least once to meet with ANBIDDY/2 and ANBANG/L. The purpose was to secure physical instruments to carry out the plan to eliminate ANTHO.
*   **Subsequent Contacts:** While there was no further direct contact with AMLASH/1 in Paris after February 1965, the Station (CLOADEN and HERLIES) maintained contact with USAPO/5, UNSHAFU/9, AMLASH/2, and AMLASH/3. AMLASH/3 made a "foliage pitch" to MRRURES in May 1968, and AMLASH/2 and AMLASH/3 were aware of AMLASH/1's plans.

## Conclusion

These documents collectively paint a picture of intense CIA activity related to Cuba during the 1960s. The focus on AMLASH highlights the agency's efforts to cultivate and utilize assets within Cuba to gather intelligence, plan operations, and potentially destabilize the Castro regime. The AMBUD operations reflect broader attempts to influence political climates in the Caribbean and Latin America. The Miro Cardona documents illustrate the strategic planning and coordination involved in anti-Castro efforts. The concerns about the publication of Federico Palmieri's book underscore the agency's efforts to manage information and protect its covert activities. The recurring themes of infiltration, sabotage, propaganda, and political maneuvering demonstrate the complex and multifaceted nature of the CIA's operations during this period.
### Understandable For A Reader Who Has Never Read JFK Files
Okay, imagine these documents as pieces of a puzzle showing the CIA's secret operations against Cuba in the 1960s, especially during and after the Cuban Missile Crisis. Since you're new to this, here's a breakdown:

**The Big Picture:**

*   **Context:** After Fidel Castro took power in Cuba in 1959, the U.S. government (specifically the CIA) was worried about Cuba becoming a communist ally of the Soviet Union, so the U.S. was trying to undermine Castro's government using various methods.
*   **Goal:** The main aim was to weaken Castro's regime. The documents show the CIA attempting to achieve this through propaganda, recruiting spies, and planning potential military actions.

**Key People & Projects:**

*   **AMLASH (Agent):** Think of AMLASH as a code name for a secret agent the CIA recruited. The documents follow his activities, plans, and meetings as he was working inside Cuba. He was involved in collecting information and discussing potential plans to destabilize the government.
*   **Miro Cardona:** He was a Cuban politician who became disillusioned with Castro and was working with the CIA to help organize anti-Castro activities.
*   **AMBUD (Project):** This was a project to influence political opinions and support in countries around Cuba, like Panama and Jamaica, to isolate Cuba. It's like trying to build allies against Castro.
*   **"El Medico y Usted" (Radio Program):** The CIA sponsored a Spanish-language medical radio program to influence public opinion. It sounds innocent, but it was a propaganda tool to get the Cuban population to listen and trust.

**Main Actions:**

*   **Recruiting Spies:** The CIA was trying to get Cubans to work for them as spies to gather information about the Cuban government.
*   **Propaganda:** This involved creating radio programs, writing newspaper articles, and spreading information to turn Cubans against Castro.
*   **Planning Military Action:** Although not always directly involved, some documents discuss possible commando raids and military actions to overthrow Castro.
*   **Collecting Intelligence:** A big part was gathering information about who was working for Castro, what their plans were, and the political climate in Cuba.
*   **Damage Control:** When a former CIA agent threatened to write a book exposing the agency's secrets, the CIA worked to figure out how to manage the damage.

**Think of it this way:**

Imagine a Cold War spy movie where the CIA is trying to recruit agents, spread disinformation, and plot to take down a hostile government. These documents are like the raw files from that movie, detailing the real-life plans and activities of the CIA during that time.

**Overall Significance:**

These documents are important because they give a glimpse into the covert and often controversial actions the CIA was taking during the Cold War to try and influence political events in Cuba and the surrounding region. They reveal the CIA's strategies, the risks they were taking, and the complex relationships they were managing with agents and other governments.
