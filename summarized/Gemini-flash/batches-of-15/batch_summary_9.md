# CIA Operations in Cuba and Mexico, 1959-1963: A Summary of Classified Documents

This summary synthesizes several classified CIA documents from 1959 to 1963, focusing on covert operations in Cuba and Mexico. These operations include audio surveillance, agent recruitment, and responses to the changing political landscape following the Cuban Revolution. The documents reveal the challenges, risks, and strategies employed by the CIA during this period.

## Audio Surveillance of the New China News Agency (NCNA) in Havana (1959-1960)

*   **Operation STESCALADE:** In May 1959, the New China News Agency (NCNA) opened an office in Havana, prompting the CIA to initiate an audio surveillance operation.
*   **Installation:** With the concurrence of Ambassador Bonsal and Embassy employee Carolyn O. Stacey, a microphone and tape recorder were installed in Stacey's adjacent apartment by November 1959.
*   **Expansion:** By June 1960, another apartment directly above the NCNA office was leased by Bryan Mills to improve surveillance capabilities.
*   **Technician Deployment:** In August 1960, three Technical Services Division (TSD) technicians installed a probe microphone and tape recorder in the new apartment. Equipment was removed from Stacey's apartment, except for the probe.
*   **Security Breach:** On 14 September 1960, technician David L. Christ (alias Carswell) missed a scheduled appointment. The next day, Cuban authorities searched the apartment of Embassy secretary Marjorie Lennox, who had unknowingly provided access for photographic surveillance.
*   **Arrests and Fallout:** Robert Neet, the stay-behind agent, and his wife were detained on 15 September. While Neet and Mrs. Lennox were later released, the three TSD technicians remained in custody.
*   **Cover Story Compromised:** The Cuban press revealed the technicians' aliases and the key to Lennox's apartment, complicating the CIA's cover story. The men were to be charged with espionage "against the people of China".
*   **Damage Control:** A New York law firm was briefed to handle inquiries, and the families of the technicians were contacted and supported by TSD staff.

## Contingency Plan for Released Agents (1962)

*   **OPLAN 62-2:** This contingency plan, dated from around 1962, outlines procedures for the secure reception of CIA employees apprehended by Cuban authorities.
*   **Personnel:** Technicians such as David L. Carswell (alias), Daniel L. Christ (alias), and Walter E. Szuminski (alias) were serving ten-year sentences and efforts were being made to secure their release.
*   **Alias Maintenance:** The plan emphasized maintaining the agents' aliases until they were safely under Agency control.
*   **Black Air Transportation:** Detachment 1, 1045th Operational Evaluation and Training Group, was tasked with providing "black air transportation" to designated sites.
*   **Activation Protocol:** Requests for black transport required specific information, including port of entry, date and time, destination, and contact details.
*   **Standby Capacity:** Detachment 1 furnished a C-54 aircraft in standby capacity, ready to position at any U.S. port of entry within 15 hours.

## Operations in Mexico City (1963)

*   **Agent Deployment:** A message from Mexico City, dated 7 December 1963, indicates the arrival of a Miss Norma Valverde via Aerolineas Panama.
*   **Communist Training Request:** A request was made on 9 December 1963, for priority Poor Old Anna (POA) to include commo training for Marta (Valdes) Hernandez Sinele, an employee in the Ministry of Health and Welfare in Havana, scheduled to return to Cuba on 20 December.
*   **Letter Drop:** A classified message on 14 December 1963, revealed a letter drop address in Mexico City for CRYSTAL-1, located at Hamburg 78, Dept. 302.
*   **Surveillance of Jerzy Plebanski:** On 14 December 1963, Jerzy Plebanski was going to Dallas to attend an international symposium. Plebanski planned to return to Mexico on 18 December.
*   **Agent KAPOK:** An agent named KAPOK was providing data on LICRAFT-1. BROTHER (another agent) felt this agent would remain inside for the foreseeable future.
*   **LIENVOY-8 Review:** A dispatch on 31 October 1963, requested an update on LIENVOY-8, who had caused a security problem in 1960 and whose clearance status was unclear.
*   **FEQ Part I:** A dispatch on 13 November 1963, references FEQ Part I on Alfonso Dibtido Torres, with a request for operational approval and a 201 number.
*   **Agent Support:** An agent in Tegucigalpa [S/] requested $190 to support his wife and children visiting from Cuba for Christmas. [S/] was living alone in the home of Eliodorina Garcia, a PCM member, in Mexico City.
*   **Agent Welcome:** A priority message on 20 December 1963, requested identification and ETA for "WELCOME HOS C/O" so they could be met at the airport. George Steens, was welcomed.
*   **Commercial Barter:** Information was gathered on Cuban government efforts to initiate commercial barter with Western European countries, particularly regarding sugar sales and debt repayment.
*   **Soviet Presence:** A message noted the departure of 400-500 Soviet technicians from Santiago de Cuba before Hurricane Cynthia, and the presence of Soviet-type equipment in Cuba.

## ZRPRIMA Program Assessment (1963)

*   **Program Review:** A multi-addressed cable from 21 November 1963, detailed a review of the ZRPRIMA program, which aimed to recruit technicians for Cuba.
*   **Failure to Meet Objectives:** The program had failed to achieve significant results, with fewer than 50 candidates receiving contract approval and only about ten making it to Cuba, well short of the initial goal of 2000 technicians.
*   **Reasons for Failure:** The failure was attributed to reluctance from the Cuban Foreign Ministry, bureaucratic incompetence, fear of infiltration, and waning interest from Fidel Castro.
*   **Program Adjustment:** Intensive searches for ZRPRIMA candidates were discontinued, but stations were urged to remain alert for opportunities to place resident agents in Cuba.

## Agent Identification (1963)

*   **Agent Identification:** A message identified RUPEK DUDIN (201-83827) and Arlette Francoise Hezarifend (alias Cartier), born on 2 March 1936 in Paris, France.

## PERUMEN Operations (1963)

*   **Agent Travel:** A message from 30 September 1963, referenced a former long-term resident of PERUMEN (identified as DESIGNET), who would return for a business trip for IDEN B.
*   **Contact Arrangements:** Mexico City was to arrange contact for DESIGNET's passage.

## Conclusion

These documents provide a glimpse into the CIA's multifaceted operations in Cuba and Mexico during the Cold War era. They highlight the challenges of conducting covert activities in a hostile environment, the importance of maintaining agent security, and the complexities of gathering intelligence on a rapidly changing political landscape. The operations ranged from audio surveillance to agent recruitment and placement, all aimed at understanding and influencing the course of events in Cuba and the surrounding region. The ZRPRIMA program's failure underscores the difficulties in achieving ambitious recruitment goals in the face of bureaucratic obstacles and shifting political priorities. The documents collectively illustrate the CIA's efforts to adapt its strategies and tactics in response to the evolving dynamics of the Cold War.

## JFK files simplified explanation

Okay, imagine the CIA was trying to spy on Cuba and other countries during the Cold War, like a game of cat and mouse. These documents are like snapshots from that game.

*   **Bugging the Chinese:** One document talks about the CIA bugging the New China News Agency in Cuba. They basically set up microphones in apartments next door and above to listen in on what the Chinese were saying. But the Cubans caught on, and some CIA agents were arrested.
*   **Getting Agents Out:** Another document is like a rescue plan. It's a plan to secretly fly out CIA agents if they were arrested in Cuba. It involved using unmarked planes and making sure the agents' cover stories stayed intact.
*   **Spies in Mexico:** Some documents mention spies and operations in Mexico City. This includes trying to recruit new spies, setting up secret locations for spies to drop off information, and keeping an eye on people who were traveling between Cuba and other countries.
*   **Recruiting Experts:** One program, called ZRPRIMA, was about trying to recruit European experts to work in Cuba. The idea was to get people with special skills to go to Cuba and maybe become spies later. But the program didn't work out very well because the Cubans weren't very good at recruiting or were afraid of spies getting in.

So, basically, these documents show the CIA trying to gather information and influence events in Cuba and Mexico during a tense time in history. They were using all sorts of sneaky tactics, but things didn't always go as planned.
