# CIA Investigation of the JFK Assassination: Oswald, the Soviets, and International Connections

This summary synthesizes multiple CIA documents related to the assassination of President John F. Kennedy, focusing on Lee Harvey Oswald's potential connections to the Soviet Union and related investigations. The documents reveal CIA activities in gathering information, addressing rumors, and cooperating (or not cooperating) with the Warren Commission and other investigative bodies.

## Italian Communist Party Rumors (March 26, 1964)

*   An article titled "The Kennedy Murder and the Secret Services of the USA" appeared in the Italian Communist Party weekly *Rinascita* on March 7, 1964.
*   The article's author, Gianfranco Corsini, a US correspondent for the Italian Communist press, referenced rumors suggesting the CIA organized President Kennedy's assassination.
*   This document shows the early awareness within the CIA of international communist speculation linking the agency to the assassination.

## Oswald's Helsinki Trip and Soviet Consulate Contact (June 1, 1964)

*   CIA officials discussed the timeline of Lee Harvey Oswald's stay in Helsinki, Finland, in October 1959, including his contact with the Soviet Consulate.
*   Frank Friberg, recently returned from Helsinki, provided information regarding travel times from the airport to downtown Helsinki and the Soviet consulate.
    *   It takes 25 minutes to drive from the airport to downtown Helsinki.
    *   It would take no more than 5 minutes by taxi to reach the Soviet consulate.
    *   The Soviet consulate probably closed at 1300 hours local time on Saturdays in 1959.
*   Passenger lists at the U.S. Consulate in Helsinki were retained for six months only and then destroyed. Mr. Robert Fulton (CIA) was U.S. consular official there at the time.
*   The CIA considered cabling the Helsinki Station for further information not covered by the State Department's inquiry, suggesting a proactive approach to address the Warren Commission's questions.
*   Lee H. Wigren, C/SR/CI/R (Counterintelligence Research) drafted a memo detailing these discussions.

## Cooperation with the Warren Commission: Soviet Emigration Policies (July 9, 1964)

*   CIA met with W. David Slawson, a staff member of the President's Commission on the Assassination of President Kennedy (Warren Commission), to discuss inconsistencies between CIA and State Department information regarding Soviet emigration policies.
*   Slawson focused on whether the Oswalds' departure from the USSR was unusual or suspicious, considering the post-Stalin era relaxation of emigration policies.
*   The discussion revolved around three key questions:
    *   Whether Soviet authorities normally permitted Soviet citizens married to foreign nationals to emigrate to their spouses' homelands.
    *   Whether they allowed such citizens to accompany their spouses simultaneously.
    *   The time required for Soviet citizens to obtain exit visas.
*   CIA clarified that their information focused on Soviet citizens accompanying their spouses, while State's information covered the broader issue of Soviets emigrating to join foreign spouses.
*   The CIA based their statements on a review of 26 cases, with only four involving Soviet wives leaving with their foreign husbands.
*   Slawson was satisfied with the explanations and requested a written reply to the Commission's letter, incorporating the discussion's substance and elaborating on Soviet visa applications.

## Investigation of Joachim Joesten (September 30, 1964)

*   The CIA initiated an investigation into Joachim Joesten, a German author born on July 29, 1907, in Cologne.
*   Joesten authored around 30 books and numerous newspaper articles, with his post-WWII works being "very anti-KUBARK" (anti-CIA).
*   His latest title was "Oswald: Assassin or Fall Guy?".
*   Joesten wrote under various pseudonyms, including Franz von Nesselrode, H.F. Likin, Walter Kell, and Paul Delathuis.
*   Captured Gestapo documents indicated that Joesten joined the German Communist Party in May 1932, with membership number 532315.
*   He owned a lending library in Berlin and resided in the USSR until 1933.
*   The CIA sought information on Joesten's entire adult career, including pre-WWII writings and references to his fianc√©e, Anna Schinsky.
*   The investigation was deemed urgent due to its relevance to the Warren Commission.

## Investigation of Roman Fedorovich Dedkov (August 10, 1964)

*   The CIA investigated Roman Fedorovich Dedkov, born on March 28, 1927, in Ariansk, USSR, and his wife, Vilasa Nikolayevna Dedkov, born on December 31, 1930, in Minsk, USSR.
*   The Dedkovs were listed as applicants for entry visas to India sometime prior to April 1962.
*   Roman Dedkov, holding Soviet passport number 207461 issued on September 17, 1960, was scheduled to arrive in New Delhi for two years as an English language teacher at the Soviet Embassy.
*   It was uncertain whether Dedkov actually arrived in New Delhi.
*   This inquiry suggests a broader effort to track individuals with potential connections to the Soviet Union, regardless of their direct involvement with Oswald or the assassination.

## Dissemination of Warren Commission Testimony (December 23, 1964)

*   The CIA distributed excerpts of Warren Commission testimony to various stations and headquarters divisions.
*   The focus was on the problem of presidential protection and interagency cooperation.
*   The extracts highlighted discussions and testimony on information acquisition, dissemination, consultation, coordination, and operational interchanges.
*   Fletcher M. Knight, Raymond G. Rocca was associated with this distribution.
*   This action reflects the CIA's effort to inform its personnel about the issues raised by the assassination and the subsequent investigation, emphasizing the importance of supporting the Secret Service, especially during presidential travels abroad.

## Continued Focus on Internal Security (Various Dates)

*   The CIA maintained a focus on internal security matters as they related to information about the JFK assassination. This is noted with records being marked for retention with either the "RID" or "PSD" records divisions.

## Request to Prevent Release of Warren Commission Document (November 26, 1968)

*   Richard Helms, Director of Central Intelligence, corresponded with Sir Charles C. F. Spry, Director General of the Australian Security Intelligence Organization (ASIO), regarding the declassification of Warren Commission document CD-971.
*   CD-971 concerned the investigation of anonymous telephone calls to the Canberra Embassy before and after Kennedy's assassination.
*   Spry recommended against declassification, and Helms concurred, citing the validity of Spry's points.
*   The document was not released due to concerns raised by ASIO, indicating sensitivity surrounding the information contained within.

## Valeriy Vladimirovich Kostikov: KGB and Oswald (May 10, 1982)

*   British Intelligence (MI6) requested information from the CIA regarding Valeriy Vladimirovich Kostikov, a KGB officer who served in Mexico City from 1961-1971 and was later posted to Beirut in 1978.
*   Kostikov was identified as KGB and served in Mexico City from 1961-71.
*   MI6 noted a reference to Kostikov in BARRON's KGB, suggesting he may have been part of Department V (responsible for assassinations).
*   MI6 also mentioned EPSTEIN's claim in "Legend" that a CIA telecheck indicated Kostikov was Lee Harvey Oswald's KGB case officer in Mexico City during Oswald's visit in September-November 1963, when Oswald sought a Soviet visa.
*   The CIA responded that Kostikov traveled to Mexico, France, Spain, the U.S., and Cuba during 1959-61 and was permanently assigned to Mexico City as a consular officer until August 1965.
*   The CIA confirmed that Kostikov handled Oswald's visa request in Mexico City in September/October 1963.
*   The CIA stated that they had no information indicating any relationship between Kostikov and Oswald other than for Oswald's visa request, though in Mexico City he was considered to be the most effective and dangerous of intelligence officers.
*   While the file indicated that Kostikov may have been a member of Department 13 (Executive Action), the CIA was unable to confirm this.
*   This exchange highlights the persistent interest in potential connections between Oswald and the KGB.

## Sergyj Czornonoh's Allegations (March 30, 1978)

*   British Intelligence forwarded correspondence from Sergyj Czornonoh, who claimed to have provided information about Lee Harvey Oswald to the American Vice Consul in Sofia, Bulgaria, in August 1963.
*   Czornonoh alleged that he informed the Vice Consul, Mr. Blackshire, about Oswald's intentions to assassinate President Kennedy, based on information from a Russian Consul.
*   Czornonoh also claimed to have reported this information to the U.S. Department of State in Washington, D.C., but was allegedly drugged and subjected to amnesia-inducing techniques by the FBI.
*   Czornonoh's letters detail a series of alleged incidents involving harassment by law enforcement agencies and claims of being targeted for political assassination.
*   The CIA noted that Richard A. Sprague, Chief Counsel and Director of the HSCA, had seen a copy of this document.
*   Czornonoh's claims, while potentially unreliable, were taken seriously enough to be shared among intelligence agencies and acknowledged by the HSCA, indicating the breadth of information being considered in connection with the assassination.

## Conclusion

These CIA documents collectively reveal the agency's extensive efforts to investigate Lee Harvey Oswald's potential connections to the Soviet Union and the circumstances surrounding President Kennedy's assassination. The documents highlight the CIA's cooperation with, and at times, divergence from, the Warren Commission's investigation. They also showcase the agency's awareness of international rumors and its proactive approach to gathering and assessing information. The investigation into figures like Joachim Joesten and Valeriy Kostikov, along with the evaluation of claims from individuals like Sergyj Czornonoh, demonstrate the complex web of leads and allegations that the CIA had to navigate in the wake of the assassination. The documents underscore the ongoing concerns about potential Soviet involvement, the internal debates about information sharing, and the enduring sensitivity surrounding the events of November 22, 1963.

## JFK Files for Dummies

Okay, imagine the CIA trying to figure out what happened with JFK's assassination. Here's a simplified version of what these files show:

*   **Rumors Fly:** Right after the assassination, some people, especially in the Communist parties, were saying the CIA was behind it. The CIA knew about these rumors.
*   **Oswald's Trip:** Lee Harvey Oswald, the assassin, went to Helsinki, Finland, before the assassination. The CIA was trying to figure out if he met with anyone important there, especially at the Soviet (Russian) embassy. They wanted to know exactly when he was there and if he made any contacts with the Russians.
*   **Warren Commission:** The government created a group called the Warren Commission to investigate the assassination. The CIA had to work with them, giving them information. There were some disagreements between what the CIA and the State Department (another part of the government) said, especially about how easy it was for Russians to leave the Soviet Union. The CIA was trying to clear up these misunderstandings.
*   **Weird Characters:** The CIA looked into some interesting people. One was a writer named Joachim Joesten who wrote books critical of the CIA and one about Oswald. The CIA wanted to know if he had any connections to the Communist party or any other reason to be interested in the assassination. Another was a Russian spy named Valeriy Kostikov. Oswald went to him to try and get a visa to go to Russia. The CIA was trying to figure out if Kostikov and Oswald knew each other beyond just that one meeting.
*   **A Crazy Guy:** A guy named Sergyj Czornonoh wrote letters saying he told the American government before the assassination that Oswald was going to kill Kennedy. He also said the FBI drugged him to make him forget. The CIA looked into this, even though it sounded kind of crazy.
*   **Keeping Secrets:** The CIA and the Australian intelligence agency (ASIO) were working together. They decided not to release a certain document about the assassination because it was too sensitive.
*   **Basically:** The CIA was trying to find out if Oswald was working with the Russians or anyone else, and if they could have prevented the assassination. They were dealing with rumors, working with government investigators, and chasing down leads, even the strange ones. They also wanted to protect their own secrets.

Think of it like a detective trying to solve a mystery. They have to follow every clue, even if it leads nowhere. These files give you a glimpse into how the CIA was doing just that after JFK was killed.
