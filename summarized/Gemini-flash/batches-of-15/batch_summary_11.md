# CIA Activities in Mexico and Latin America, Late 1963

This summary compiles classified CIA documents from November and December 1963, shedding light on the agency's activities in Mexico and Latin America. The documents reveal operations targeting individuals of interest, monitoring of political activities, and efforts to counter Cuban influence in the region.

## Key Operations and Individuals

*   **Milton Lywn:** ODCOIL MEXI should be given lead on Milton Lywn, avoiding KUBARK involvement (6 NOVEMBER). The CIA aimed to assess and develop a rapport with Ernesto Abreu Gomez, possibly introducing him to an ODCOIL agent.

*   **Ernesto Abreu Gomez:** Target for development for PERUKEN operations (6 NOVEMBER).

*   **Pedroza Be Leiva:** Residing in Mexico, friend of LIFANIL 2) family, very probably wife of XIO LAYVA FUENTES and Cuban intelligence officer previously reported. Important recruitment/defection target (December). The agency requested the possibility of utilizing Pedroza as a lead to ERYVA. Traces on PEDROGA were negative.

*   **Fernando Palenzuela Vaquet & Maria Francisca Crespo Falcon:** Identified as residents of Havana, Cuba (December).

*   **Grace Holmes:** P.O. Box 1767, Coral Gables, Florida (December). The message was sent to Mexico City, Bogota, Lima, and Guatemala.

*   **Kansahi Watanabe & Kenneth K. Suzuki:** Watanabe and Suzuki's information was circulated on December. Kenneth K. Suzuki was associated with Trans Pacific Commerce Consultants in San Francisco.

*   **Journalist Frank Pilgrim:** Representing the Manchester Guardian, Pilgrim was planning to attend Cuban anniversary celebrations on 1 January and would likely leave for Mexico afterward (December). KUBARK was requested not to contact him, with SEOTH to provide debriefing results.

## Political Activities and Influence Operations

*   **Brazilian Elections:** The CIA was involved in providing funds to Ari Campista, president of the Guanabara Chemical Workers Federation, for use in December elections (December). The funds, amounting to CR$ 5,999,999, were intended to gain support for a democratic slate. The CIA sought clarification to avoid conflicts among Democrats. Funds were also being prepared for Hugo Gomes da Costa, of alcohol and sugar workers.

*   **Latin American Study Seminar (LASS):** Discussions were held regarding tactics for the Latin American Study Seminar (LABS), regardless of whether the seminar was ultimately held (December). The agency aimed to seize the initiative and potentially offer an invitation from an unfriendly site. Conditions for holding the LASS included participation from a minimum of 7 democratic unions. The CIA also considered scenarios for withdrawing the invitation or postponing the LASS, dependent on various factors including extremist counteraction and potential harm to other programs.

*   **Anti-Castro Efforts:** The CIA aimed to demonstrate to local governments that public opinion favored Venezuela's position against Castro within the OAS (December). Activities concentrated on encouraging governments to adopt a stronger stance. The agency promoted the theme of "no coexistence with Castro" and suggested using labor and student organizations to send telegrams in support of Venezuela's position. They also considered using the PBG narrative that Castro was exporting crime.

## Counterintelligence and Surveillance

*   **Soviet State Security Anniversary:** The CIA alerted stations to the upcoming 46th anniversary of the founding of the Soviet State Security Organization (December). This event, traditionally celebrated by KGB residencies, presented an opportunity for new identifications or confirmation of previous identifications through surveillance.

*   **Identification Coverage:** The CIA desired LIFEAT coverage on an ID soon as practicable, believing an EX to be a local case officer (December). Coverage of AMBESS/1 could be suspended if necessary to effect coverage on the IDEN, but maintaining both was preferred.

## Code Names and Operational Security

*   **PBRUMEN:** Associated with ODCOIL MEXI, Abreu Gomez, and Merida (November).
*   **PERUKEN:** Operations involving Abreu Gomez and the Merida police chief (November).
*   **KUBARK:** An entity the CIA aimed to avoid involving in the Milton Lywn case (November).
*   **LIFEAT:** A surveillance operation (December).
*   **AMBESS/1:** Another surveillance operation (December).
*   **LITAMIL:** Report related to Pedroza Be Leiva (December).
*   **KYBAT:** Reference material (December).

## Conclusion

These documents reveal a snapshot of the CIA's multifaceted operations in Mexico and Latin America during late 1963. The agency was actively involved in intelligence gathering, surveillance, political influence operations, and counterintelligence efforts. The operations targeted individuals, monitored political activities, and aimed to counter Cuban influence in the region. The use of code names, secure communication channels, and compartmentalization of information underscores the clandestine nature of these activities.

## Explanation for Readers Unfamiliar with the JFK Files

Okay, imagine you're reading a spy novel, but instead of a story, you're looking at real, secret memos. These documents are from the CIA in late 1963, right before President Kennedy was assassinated. They show what the CIA was up to in Mexico and other parts of Latin America at the time.

*   **Secret Missions:** The CIA was trying to keep an eye on people they thought were important, like potential spies or people connected to Cuba. They used code names to refer to these people and their missions to keep things secret.

*   **Political Games:** They were also involved in trying to influence politics. For example, they were giving money to certain groups in Brazil to help them win elections. This was all part of the Cold War, where the US was trying to stop the spread of communism.

*   **Watching the Soviets:** The CIA was also keeping tabs on the Soviet Union's activities. They knew that the KGB (the Soviet spy agency) would be celebrating a special anniversary and thought it was a good chance to identify Soviet spies.

*   **Stopping Cuba:** A big focus was on countering Cuba's influence in Latin America. Cuba had become communist, and the US didn't want other countries in the region to follow suit. So, the CIA was trying to undermine Cuba's government and stop it from spreading its ideas.

*   **Why This Matters:** These documents are important because they give us a glimpse into the hidden world of the CIA. They show how the agency operated during a critical time in history. By understanding these activities, we can better understand the context of events like the Kennedy assassination, even though these documents do not directly relate to the event. Think of it like looking at the pieces of a puzzle â€“ each document helps us see the bigger picture of what was happening behind the scenes.
