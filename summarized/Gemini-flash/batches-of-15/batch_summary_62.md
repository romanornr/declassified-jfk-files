# CIA Covert Operations: Castro Assassination Attempts, Anti-Communist Activities, and Internal Reorganization (1961-1963)

This summary analyzes declassified CIA documents from 1961 to 1963, focusing on covert operations against Fidel Castro, anti-communist activities in various countries, and internal reorganization efforts within the CIA. The documents reveal a complex web of political intrigue, assassination plots, and concerns about the CIA's autonomy and oversight.

## Operation Mongoose and ZRRIFLE: Targeting Castro

*   **Operation Mongoose (1962):** This operation involved intelligence, political, economic, psychological, paramilitary, and military activities aimed at destabilizing the Cuban regime.
    *   A memorandum from August 13, 1962, assigned William Harvey the task of drafting an outline for the implementation of MONGOOSE, including planning for "splitting the regime, including liquidation of leaders".
    *   William Harvey later excised the words "including liquidation of leaders" from the LANSDALE memo due to concerns about the sensitivity and inadmissibility of putting such comments in writing.
    *   Secretary McNamara raised the subject of assassinations at the Special Group (Augmented) meeting of August 10.
*   **ZRRIFLE (1961-1963):** This project, led by William Harvey, focused on developing an "executive action capability," essentially an assassination unit.
    *   February 1961: Bissell (DDP) asks Harvey to establish an EXECUTIVE ACTION capability under project ZRRIFLE.
    *   Harvey used agent QJWIN, initially recruited for the assassination of LUMUMBA, as the primary asset.
    *   The project involved collaboration with the criminal syndicate, specifically using figures like John Roselli and Santo Trafficante.
    *   Various methods were explored, including the use of poison pills.

### Poison Pill Plots and Mafia Connections

*   **1960-1962:** The CIA explored various methods to assassinate Castro, including poison pills.
    *   August 16, 1960: DR. EDWARD GUNN (Office of Medical Services) receives box of Cuban cigars to be treated with lethal poison.
    *   Late January 1961: EDWARDS and O'CONNELL ask for development of POISON PILLS.
    *   February 1961: Pills given to ROSELLI by O'CONNELL are passed to TRAFFICANTE.
    *   April 18-19, 1962: Pills are delivered to Harvey in Washington.
    *   Roselli's connections with the Mafia were exploited to introduce the pills into Castro's food.
    *   Multiple attempts were made, but none were successful, often due to the pills being detected or the opportunity not arising.
*   **May 7, 1962:** EDWARDS and HOUSTON brief ATTORNEY GENERAL ROBERT F. KENNEDY on PHASE I of the assassination operation.
    *   RFK asks to be told before the CIA works with the Mafia again.
    *   Harvey briefed HELMS about this and advised against briefing McCone (DCI) or Carter (DDCI); Helms agreed.

### Marie Lorenz: The Mata Hari

*   **1959-1960:** Marie Lorenz, a German-American woman, became involved with Fidel Castro and was later recruited by the CIA to assassinate him.
    *   Lorenz met Castro in February 1959 aboard a cruise ship.
    *   She became Castro's personal interpreter and lived in his suite at the Havana Hilton.
    *   Frank Fiorini (later Frank Sturgis), a CIA agent, contacted her and persuaded her to spy on Castro.
    *   In 1960, the CIA sent her back to Cuba with poison pills to put in Castro's coffee, but the mission failed.
    *   The capsules were melted and she couldn't complete the mission.

## CIA's Anti-Communist Activities in Latin America and Southeast Asia

### Cuba

*   **Cuban Exile Base in Nicaragua (1963):** The documents suggest the possible establishment of a Cuban exile base in Nicaragua.
    *   July 24, 1963: Salvador Romani claimed that a small number Cuban exiles had already moved from Miami to Nicaragua.
    *   It was believed this action reflects a previous agreement between President Somoza of Nicaragua and Manuel Artime.
    *   The nucleus of such a base would be drawn from three to four thousand exiles who have previously received military training from members of U.S. Armed Forces.
*   **Cuban Exile Plans (1963):** Cuban exile groups were planning attacks on the Cuban mainland.
    *   Amaury Fraginals Alonso claimed that the alliance will continue to attack the Cuban mainland.
    *   Plans were going ahead to launch Plan Omega.
    *   The Frente Anti-Communista de Liberacion (Anti-Communist Liberation Front - FAL) within the Cuban army was an important factor in the "forthcoming war" in Cuba.
*   **Cuban Financing of Subversive Operations (1963):** The documents describe Cuban financing of subversive operations in Latin America.
    *   The evidence shows that it is generally effected by couriers carrying cash.
    *   A Venezuelan politician, Fabricio Ojeda, returned from Cuba in March of 1962, and was seen by several witnesses to have large quantities of US currency stuffed in a false-bottomed compartment of his suitcase.
    *   A Nicaraguan exile, Julio Cesar Mayorga Portocarrera, was found to be carrying $3,600 in cash from Cuba for Nicaraguan rebels in Honduras.
    *   Guatemalan and Brazilian guerrillas also received funding from Cuba, sometimes funneled through China.
*   **Cuban-Trained Peruvian Guerrillas (1963):** The documents reveal a network assisting Cuban-trained Latin Americans to re-enter their own countries.
    *   More than 70 Peruvians were trained in Cuba from June until December 1962.
    *   The agency asset acts as coordinator, helping the Peruvians to return illegally to Peru.
    *   MIR trainees were told not to ask for aid from the Soviets to avoid straining relations with China, "since it is backing them".

### Vietnam

*   **Withdrawal of United Nations Troops from the Congo (1963):** There were definite plans being made for the withdrawal of United Nations troops in the Congo at the end of 1963 despite Congolese Premier Cyrille Adoula's pleas to the contrary.
*   **Local Currency: Costs Problem (1961):** A message has been sent to Saigon requesting the Embassy to undertake negotiations with the GVN and offering three alternatives in descending order of preference.
*   **Vietnamese Communist Analysis of Efforts (1962):** The US' half success is due to use of counterguerrilla tactics, but mopping up operations will lead to defeat because (indiscriminate) killings will push the people toward the revolutionary party.
*   **Opposition in Khanh Hoa Province (1962):** Khanh Hoa provincial authorities are strongly opposed to the American policy of economic aid, training, and arms for the tribal people.
*   **Possible severence of Cambodian (1962):** The Royal Cambodian Government /RKG/ is planning to sever relations with South Vietnam.

## CIA Internal Reorganization

*   **CIA Autonomy Concerns (1961):** Arthur Schlesinger Jr. prepared a memorandum for President Kennedy expressing concerns about the CIA's autonomy.
    *   Schlesinger argued that the CIA had developed a "state within a state" and that its operations were not adequately controlled by the State Department.
    *   He proposed that the State Department be granted general clearance authority over all clandestine activity, potentially by appointing a Deputy Undersecretary of State for Intelligence.
    *   He suggested reconstituting the operating branches of the present CIA under some blameless title (the National Information Service).
    *   A second semi-independent agency would be set up, again bearing a blameless title (the Foreign Research Agency), coordinate with the operations agency.

## Conclusion

These declassified documents paint a picture of the CIA deeply involved in covert activities during the early 1960s. The agency pursued aggressive strategies to counter communism, including attempts to assassinate Fidel Castro and support anti-communist forces in Latin America and Southeast Asia. Concerns about the CIA's autonomy, ethical considerations, and the potential for these operations to undermine U.S. foreign policy led to internal discussions about reorganization and oversight. The findings underscore the complexities and controversies surrounding the CIA's role during the Cold War, raising important questions about the balance between national security and the preservation of democratic values.

## Explanation for Readers Unfamiliar with the JFK Files

Okay, imagine you're watching a spy movie, but instead of just being entertained, you want to understand the *real* history behind some of the storylines. These declassified CIA documents are like a behind-the-scenes look at some of the most secretive operations during the Cold War, specifically focusing on the Kennedy era.

**Here's the gist, broken down:**

*   **The Main Target: Fidel Castro.** The US government was deeply worried about Cuba becoming a communist stronghold so close to American shores. One of the main goals was to get rid of Fidel Castro, the Cuban leader.
*   **Secret Plans and Code Names:** They had operations with names like "Operation Mongoose" and "ZRRIFLE." These were top-secret plans that involved everything from economic sabotage to assassination attempts. Think of it like a video game where they were trying every trick in the book to weaken or eliminate Castro.
*   **Working with the Mafia:** Believe it or not, the CIA even considered working with the Mafia, who had lost their casinos and businesses in Cuba after Castro took over. The idea was that the Mafia could help them get close to Castro to assassinate him. This is as crazy as it sounds, but these documents show it was a real consideration.
*   **Poison and Double Agents:** They explored different ways to kill Castro, including using poison pills. They even recruited a woman named Marie Lorenz, who was one of Castro's former lovers, to try and slip the poison into his food. This is like something straight out of a James Bond movie!
*   **Beyond Cuba: Fighting Communism Elsewhere:** It wasn't just about Cuba. The CIA was also involved in fighting communism in other countries, like Vietnam and the Congo. They were providing support, training, and weapons to anti-communist forces.
*   **Worries About the CIA's Power:** Some people within the government, like Arthur Schlesinger Jr., started to worry that the CIA was becoming too powerful and operating without enough oversight. They thought the CIA was almost like a "state within a state," making its own rules and not being accountable enough to the President or the State Department.
*   **Reorganization Ideas:** Because of these concerns, there were discussions about how to reorganize the CIA and make it more accountable. This included ideas like having the State Department have more control over the CIA's operations.

**Why does this matter for the JFK files?**

These documents provide context for understanding the intense political climate of the early 1960s. The obsession with Castro, the willingness to use questionable tactics, and the concerns about the CIA's power are all important pieces of the puzzle when trying to understand the events surrounding President Kennedy's assassination. It shows the world Kennedy was operating in, filled with intrigue, secrets, and powerful agencies working in the shadows. It also sheds light on potential motives some groups might have had for wanting Kennedy out of the picture if they disagreed with his approach to Cuba or the CIA.
