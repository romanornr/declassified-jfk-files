# Operation KDFACTOR: CIA Surveillance in Mexico City and Beyond

This summary synthesizes classified CIA documents detailing Operation KDFACTOR and related activities, primarily focusing on surveillance operations conducted in Mexico City between 1962 and 1973. These operations aimed to gather intelligence on Soviet, Cuban, and other foreign entities, as well as leftist political movements, through various means including wiretaps (LIENVOY and LIFEAT projects) and photographic surveillance.

## I. Recruitment and Operational Activities in El Salvador

### Interrogation and Recruitment Attempts

*   In San Salvador, the CIA station sought approval for AMMUG-1, a resource with knowledge of El Salvadorans trained by the DGI (Cuban Intelligence), to stand by for operational possibilities.
*   The station requested the arrest of **Jose Rehberto Carrillo Calderon** (281-158959) by JUSLOOP-1 for interrogation and potential recruitment in a joint operation against POEs (likely meaning People's Organizations). Carrillo's address in Ahuachapan was provided.
*   The CIA was also planning to recruit **Alejandro Gonez Montano** (281-731263), who was arrested on 29 March 1967 for lacking identification. JUMUD-13, a unilateral agent, suggested arresting Gomez again for recruitment purposes. However, the station preferred a unilateral approach upon Gomez's release.

## II. Cuban Intelligence Activities in Haiti and the Dominican Republic

### Policy Directives for Cuban Intelligence

*   A former Cuban intelligence officer provided documents outlining policy guidance directives for Cuban intelligence representatives in Haiti and the Dominican Republic, prepared by the DGI's MA Department (later divided into the Illegal Department and the National Liberation Department). These directives prioritized:
    *   Plans of aggression against Cuba.
    *   Progressive political forces.
    *   Attitudes of political parties toward the Cuban Revolution.
    *   Movements for solidarity with Cuba.
    *   Strategic information.
    *   The Communist Party of Haiti/Dominican Republic.

### Key Objectives in Haiti

*   Gathering strategic information, particularly regarding counterrevolutionary operations, the Haitian Armed Forces, and the Communist Party of Haiti (Party of Popular Accord).
*   Monitoring relations between Haiti and the United States, internal politics, social situations, the Church, and foreign diplomatic personnel.

### Key Objectives in the Dominican Republic

*   Assessing collective action against Cuba and the status of leftist forces.
*   Monitoring the Dominican Republic Armed Forces, the Dominican Communist Party (Partido Socialista Popular Dominicano), training camps, and counterrevolutionary organizations.
*   Investigating repressive bodies, the CIA's Santo Domingo operations, political parties, and movements for solidarity with Cuba.
*   Evaluating relations with the United States and the Church.

## III. Personnel Profiles and Operations

### Monitoring of Cuban Intelligence Officers

*   **Fernando FUENTES Coba:** A former lieutenant in the Cuban Police Force, possibly discharged due to drug-related issues, was reportedly working in a printing establishment in Halifax, Canada, in 1964. He had a history of involvement in foreign intelligence operations for the National Revolutionary Police (PNR) and later worked for the Tourist Police and Transit Police. He was also implicated in forging birth certificates to help Cubans enter the US and served as a Castro agent.
*   **(fnu) RELOVA:** An officer of the DGI residing in Habana, was identified through airline passenger manifests as Osvaldo RELOVA Penichet, who traveled between Mexico, Canada, and Cuba. He held various positions, including administrator of "Envases del Cerro, S.A." and "Embassy Inspector" for the Cuban Embassy in Canada.
*   **Julian NOVAS Fernandez:** Identified as a Cuban Intelligence Officer stationed at the Cuban Consulate in Kingston, Jamaica, as a Commercial Attache. He was born on 2 September 1938 in Habana, Cuba.

## IV. KDFACTOR Project in Mexico City

### Photographic Surveillance Operations

*   The KDFACTOR Project involved visual and photographic surveillance of the Soviet Embassy in Mexico City, employing two surveillance points: KDLITERAL and KDABSINTHE.
*   KDLITERAL provided photographic coverage of PCS (Permanent Change of Station) and TDY (Temporary Duty) personnel within the compound, while KDABSINTHE focused on visitors, particularly "WOCORK-type" persons and political exiles.
*   The project utilized five salaried assets and produced substantial photographic intelligence, including license plate identifications and "attendance sheets" of embassy personnel.

### Project Termination and Security Review

*   The KDFACTOR Project was terminated in 1972 following a security review indicating that the VWBLANKET principal was aware of the project's details.
*   Agent termination costs amounted to $15,573 pesos ($15,572.72 USD), with individual payments varying based on tenure and local laws.
*   A request was made to amend the project budget to cover an overrun in termination expenses due to miscalculations.
*   The CIA had concerns about a potential compromise due to the terminated agents' knowledge of targets, safesites, and personnel, but assessed the risk as acceptable due to the compatible nature of KDFACTOR's operations.

### Key Personnel

*   **Oliver J. MANKUNAS:** Responsible for inside administrative chores and agent handling.
*   **Bruce H. FERNALD:** Alternate case officer.
*   **KDFACTOR-2:** Operated the KDLITERAL basehouse.
*   **KDFACTOR-5:** Operated the KDABSINTHE basehouse.
*   **KDFACTOR-1:** Former photo product processor, terminated amicably.
*   **Howard T. BAGAUS:** Handled project administration initially.

## V. LIENVOY Project: Wiretapping in Mexico

### Wiretap Operations and Targets

*   The LIENVOY Project involved wiretapping operations targeting the Cuban and Soviet Embassies, as well as Yugoslavian diplomatic lines in Mexico City.
*   Key figures like Lázaro Cárdenas del Río, Braulio Maldonado Sandez, and David Alfaro Siqueiros were also targeted.
*   The project aimed to gather intelligence on leftist political organizations and individuals.

### Personnel and Exploitation

*   The project utilized multiple translators, including Orville HORSFALL, David B. SCHLAGETER, Victor W. OBOLD, and Douglas J. FEINGLASS.
*   LIENVOY information was exploited to support other operations, such as the REWOOD AEJUMBO operation, and to gather intelligence on Soviet and Cuban activities.

### Key Findings and Actions

*   LIENVOY intercepts led to the identification of a Russian-speaking professor from New Orleans who contacted the Soviet Embassy.
*   Contacts between the Partido Popular Socialista and the Soviet Embassy were also revealed.
*   The project's success was attributed to a strong agreement with Mexican officials, effective native monitoring staff, and efficient handling of intercepted data.

## VI. Proposed Infrastructure and Security Considerations

### Basehouse Infrastructure and Security

*   The CIA considered rebuilding or selling a LIMITED property used as a photo basehouse due to its deteriorating condition.
*   Proposals included razing the building and constructing a new structure with commercial income-generating ventures, such as a store and apartments.
*   Concerns were raised about the proprietary nature of such ventures and the potential for Soviet countermeasures.
*   The preferred solution was to rebuild the house on the same land for occupancy by basehouse keepers.

## VII. Conclusion and Implications

These documents collectively highlight the CIA's extensive surveillance and intelligence-gathering activities in Mexico City and other Latin American countries during the Cold War era. The operations targeted Soviet and Cuban diplomatic missions, as well as local leftist movements, aiming to counter perceived threats to US interests. The success of these operations depended on a complex network of assets, including informants, translators, and technical personnel, as well as collaboration with local governments. The projects reflect the intricate strategies and considerations involved in Cold War intelligence, balancing the need for information with the risks of exposure and potential damage to diplomatic relations. The termination of Operation KDFACTOR due to security compromises highlights the ever-present challenges of maintaining secrecy in such operations.
## Simplified Summary for Readers Unfamiliar with the JFK Files

Okay, imagine you're watching a spy movie set during the Cold War. These documents are like behind-the-scenes notes for that movie, revealing how the CIA was trying to gather information about Cuba and the Soviet Union in the 1960s and early 1970s.

**Here's the basic story:**

*   **The CIA was worried about Cuba and the Soviet Union's influence in Latin America.** They believed Cuba, under Fidel Castro, was trying to spread communism to other countries.
*   **Mexico City was a hotspot.** Because Mexico was relatively open, it became a place where Soviet and Cuban officials could meet and operate.
*   **The CIA ran secret operations to keep an eye on them.**
    *   **Wiretaps:** They secretly listened to phone calls made from the Cuban and Soviet embassies. This operation had code names like "LIENVOY" and "LIFEAT". The wiretaps helped them learn who was talking to whom and what they were planning.
    *   **Photographic Surveillance:** They set up apartments overlooking the Soviet embassy to take pictures of people coming and going. This was called "KDFACTOR."
    *   **Recruiting Agents:** They tried to recruit people in other countries, like El Salvador, to spy for them.
*   **The CIA wasn't just focused on embassies:** They were also interested in local political groups that seemed to support communist ideas.
*   **The Agents Faced Risks:** Because the operations are a secret, it was always a risk that someone could find out the operations and blow their cover. The agency even had to close down on of their project to avoid getting caught.

**What this means:**

These documents provide a glimpse into the secret world of Cold War espionage. The CIA was actively trying to understand and counter what it saw as communist threats in Latin America. The agency’s tactics sometimes involved questionable activity, like planting wiretaps and attempting to recruit people to act as spies. The constant concern about security and the details of how these operations were run are fascinating.
