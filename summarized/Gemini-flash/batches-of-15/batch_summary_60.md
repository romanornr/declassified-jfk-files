# Navigating Cold War Espionage: A Summary of CIA and FBI Activities Related to Cuba

This document summary compiles various FBI and CIA memos from 1959 to 1965, shedding light on the agencies' coordinated efforts to monitor individuals, gather intelligence on Cuban activities, and manage sensitive information during the Cold War era. The documents illustrate the intricate web of espionage, counterintelligence, and liaison activities between the two agencies, particularly concerning Cuba and its international connections.

## Monitoring Individuals with Suspected Cuban Ties

*   **Levi Laub (July 5, 1963):** The FBI investigated Levi Laub's unauthorized travel to Cuba between February 22 and March 11, 1963. Information came from the British Intelligence Service (MI-6), which received it from Gavin Young, a British newspaperman. MI-6 planned to make Young available for an interview by the FBI.
*   **Jorge Beliard (June 26 & 30, 1961):** Jorge Beliard, a station manager for Cubana Airlines at Idlewild International Airport in New York City, was identified as a potential asset for establishing courier routes between the U.S. and Cuba. The CIA sought the FBI's permission to contact Beliard, and the FBI considered whether to allow the CIA to operate independently or to act as an intermediary. Beliard had been providing data on Cubana Airlines operations and personnel to the New York FBI office since November 1960.
*   **Ismael Rodriguez (August 17, 1961):** Ismael Rodriguez, the comptroller of Cubana Airlines in New York City, was used by the CIA as a courier for transmitting materials between the U.S. and Cuba related to CIA operations.

## Investigating Financial Links and Potential Communist Support

*   **Eduardo Espinosa y Prieto (August 28, 1961 & July 27, 1961):** The CIA sought to share information with the West German Bundesamt fuer Verfassungsschutz (BFV) regarding Eduardo Espinosa y Prieto, the Mexican Ambassador to Warsaw. Espinosa was known to write bank drafts to individuals allegedly connected to communist activities during his tenure at the United Nations in New York City (August 1957 to summer 1960). The FBI advised against suggesting that Espinosa "was used as a means of financing Communist Party activities" due to a lack of substantiating evidence. Further investigation revealed that a German citizen in Bremen, suspected of Polish Intelligence Service activities, received a $1,000 deposit from Espinosa. His wife, Tamara Espinosa, was reported to have been an agent of the Soviet security services.
*   **Henryk Ignacy Janikowski (August 16, 1963):** The CIA provided information on Henryk Ignacy Janikowski, a Polish national, including details about financial transactions involving Eduardo Espinosa y Prieto. Espinosa sent a check for $1,000 to Erik Schott in Bremen, Germany, to be deposited in Janikowski's account. Schott stated that Janikowski obtained dollars for purchasing cars via an unknown Polish sailor and through the black market and exhibitors at the Poznan Fair.

## Gathering Intelligence on Cuban Activities and Personnel

*   **Enrique Garcia Armenteros (October 15, 1963):** The CIA placed an agent in Cuba to gather information in response to an FBI lead concerning Enrique Garcia Armenteros.
*   **Paul Hickman (December 2, 1959):** The Swiss police located Paul Hickman in Zurich, Switzerland, where he was allegedly involved in business dealings related to the sale of arms to the Castro government. Hickman claimed to have volunteered information to "friends of Senator Smathers" and had contacted a Soviet Embassy representative in Bern regarding a Cuban sugar sale to Russia.
*   **Manuel Pineiro (October 10, 1963):** Manuel Pineiro, a high-ranking official in the Cuban G-2 organization, was tentatively identified by the CIA as "Petronio," who signed messages to a Cuban agent in Panama. This conclusion was based on intercepted communications and analysis of a Cuban agent in Colombia who had violated communication protocols.
*   **Soviet Embassy in Havana (November 21, 1960):** The FBI provided the CIA with information about an order of ten safes from the Mosler Safe Company destined for the Soviet Embassy in Havana, Cuba, including model numbers, serial numbers, and combinations. The FBI obtained the keys and combinations through an established source at the company's factory.

## Monitoring Cuban Political Sentiment and International Relations

*   **Raul Roa (May 10, 1963):** Information from a highly confidential informant indicated that Cuban Foreign Minister Raul Roa expressed pessimistic views on Cuba's situation around February 20, 1963. Roa believed the Sino-Indian conflict benefited the United States and that the situation in Cuba was deteriorating due to the failure of talks at the United Nations. He also alluded that the United States benefited from excluding the Security Council and instead permitting the Organization of American States (OAS) to handle the Cuban situation.
*   **Intelligence Matters Cuba (October 2, 1963):** The State Department preferred that the CIA handle the matter through the Spanish Government or the Swiss Embassy in Havana, to obtain Garcia's papers since they could conceivably contain intelligence and/or propaganda data of interest to the United States Government

## Investigating Economic Activities and Potential Export Violations

*   **Herbert Levy (November 28, 1961 & December 11, 1961):** Herbert Levy, Director of Central Operations at St. Regis Paper Company, provided information concerning large quantities of jute bags and Hessian cloth sought by the Cuban government through the International Ore and Fertilizer Company. Levy had previously provided information to the CIA regarding economic matters in India and expressed a willingness to continue providing information, but only to the CIA.

## Conclusion

These documents reveal the coordinated efforts of the FBI and CIA to gather intelligence, monitor individuals, and assess the political and economic landscape surrounding Cuba during the Cold War. The agencies' liaison activities facilitated the sharing of information on suspected individuals like Levi Laub, Jorge Beliard, and Ismael Rodriguez. Investigations into financial transactions involving figures such as Eduardo Espinosa y Prieto and Henryk Ignacy Janikowski underscore the agencies' efforts to uncover potential communist support and financial networks. The surveillance of Cuban activities and personnel, exemplified by cases like Enrique Garcia Armenteros and Manuel Pineiro, highlights the intense focus on Cuban intelligence operations. Furthermore, monitoring Cuban political sentiment through figures like Raul Roa and investigating economic activities involving individuals like Herbert Levy underscore the agencies' comprehensive approach to understanding and countering Cuban influence during a critical period in global politics. The implications of these findings emphasize the complex dynamics of Cold War espionage and the vital role of inter-agency collaboration in safeguarding U.S. interests.

## JFK Files Summary for Beginners

Imagine the Cold War, where the US and the Soviet Union were like two superpowers playing a tense game of chess. Cuba, a small island nation close to the US, became a pawn in this game when it turned communist under Fidel Castro. This made the US very nervous, and its intelligence agencies, like the FBI and CIA, kicked into high gear to keep a close eye on Cuba.

The documents we've summarized give us a peek into how these agencies worked together to gather information and protect US interests. Here's what you need to know:

*   **Spies and Informants:** The FBI and CIA were constantly on the lookout for people who might be helping Cuba, whether they were doing it willingly or not. They kept tabs on individuals like Levi Laub, who traveled to Cuba, and Jorge Beliard, an airline employee who could have helped set up secret routes for information.
*   **Following the Money:** They also tracked money trails to see if anyone was funding communist activities in Cuba. For example, they investigated Eduardo Espinosa y Prieto, a Mexican diplomat, to see if he was connected to communist groups.
*   **Eavesdropping:** The agencies listened in on conversations and intercepted messages to learn what Cuban officials were thinking and planning. This is how they found out that Raul Roa, a Cuban Foreign Minister, was worried about Cuba's situation and how the US was benefiting from it.
*   **Working with Other Countries:** The FBI and CIA didn't just work alone. They shared information with intelligence agencies in other countries, like Britain and West Germany, to get a more complete picture of what was happening.
*   **Why It Matters:** All of this spying and information gathering was part of the US effort to contain communism and protect itself from potential threats during the Cold War. These documents show the lengths to which the government went to monitor Cuba and its connections, both at home and abroad.

In short, these JFK files give us a glimpse into the world of Cold War espionage, where the US government was constantly watching, listening, and gathering information to stay one step ahead in its global struggle against communism.
