# Classified CIA Operations: Economic Instability in Cuba, Infiltration Attempts, and Handling of Defectors

This summary synthesizes multiple classified CIA documents from 1955 to 1976, revealing insights into Cuban economic conditions after the revolution, attempts to infiltrate Cuba, and the CIA's handling of defectors, specifically focusing on individuals like Agustin Guitart Campuzano and Maurice Hyman Halperin.

## Cuban Economic Crisis (1959)

The documents from August 1959 paint a grim picture of Cuba's economic situation following Fidel Castro's rise to power.

*   **Deteriorating Financial Status:** Contrary to government reports, Cuba's financial state was rapidly deteriorating. An advisor warned Castro in July 1959 to slow down agrarian reforms due to dwindling treasury funds.
*   **Bankrupt Sugar Mills:** 57 sugar mills were bankrupt and unable to pay plantation owners for the 1959 crop.
*   **Government Subsidies:** The Banco de Desarrollo Econ√≥mico y Social (BANDES) controlled significant assets (U.S. $400 million) but required substantial government subsidies (U.S. $8 million monthly), draining the treasury.
*   **Growing Unemployment:** Farm workers faced increasing unemployment as plantation owners, fearing property confiscation, reduced maintenance work.
*   **Castro's Determination:** Despite warnings, Castro intensified the agrarian reform program, potentially leading to confiscation of bank accounts and a need for a major loan, possibly from the Soviet Union.
*   **Source: Alberto FERNANDEZ Rechavarria:** Chief of the Cuban Sugar Stabilization Board, disillusioned with Castro's reforms, described Castro as ruthless and determined, willing to sacrifice everything for his goals.
*   **Security Concerns:** Fernandez Rechavarria feared contact with American officials, noting that his calls were recorded, and his movements were checked.

These reports suggest that the CIA was closely monitoring Cuba's economic instability, anticipating potential consequences like a shift toward the Soviet Union.

## JM/WAVE Operations and Cuban Infiltration (1961-1963)

These documents outline CIA operations (JM/WAVE) focused on infiltrating individuals into Cuba (PBRUMEN).

*   **Operation JEAN:** A series of operations aimed at infiltrating individuals into Cuba.
    *   **March 23, 1961:** Infiltration via GHA JEAN III included individuals such as Alco Vera Serafit, Braidio Contrera, Angel Posada Gutierrez, Rinaldo Hernandez Blanco, and others.
    *   **February 24, 1961:** TEJANA was due to depart Key West to run OPN JEAN, infiltating cargo and personnel including trainees Emilio Martinez, Oliverio Toneu, Rafael Alvarez Fernandez-Garrido, and Carlos Poveda.
*   **GYROSE/COMMO/AMDENIM:** Activities involving AMDENIM-1, engaged in maintaining contacts with exile groups and planning infiltration into PBRUMEN.
    *   **AMDENIM-1 Progress Report (August 13, 1962):** AMDENIM-1 prepared reports, coordinated selection of paramilitary candidates from exile groups, and attempted to contact PBRUMEN fishermen through Operation Antonico I.
    *   **Operation Antonico I:** An unsuccessful attempt to establish contact with fishermen due to internal issues.
*   **Candidate Evaluation:** Focus on self-sufficient personnel capable of establishing clandestine bases within Cuba.
*   **Personnel:** Benicia (Gonzalez) Gomez was considered a RADOP candidate for infiltration.
*   **Boat Acquisition:** Antonio Cuesta, associated with Mrs. Geddes, inquired about purchasing a high-speed boat, possibly for return to PBRUMEN.

These operations reflect the CIA's active efforts to gather intelligence and potentially destabilize the Castro regime through covert actions.

## Agustin Guitart Campuzano: Operational Approval and Security Vetting (1961-1964)

These documents detail the CIA's assessment and potential use of Dr. Agustin Guitart Campuzano.

*   **Background:** Born in Cardenas, Cuba on April 25, 1910, Guitart was a doctor of science and professor, previously serving as Minister of Education under Carlos Prio.
*   **Operational Approval Process:** The CIA considered Guitart for operational use, initiating a Provisional Operational Approval (POA) in July 1963.
*   **Security Checks:** Involved FBI coordination, RI traces, division traces, and field traces. The subject resided in New Orleans, which required coordination with the FBI.
*   **Purpose:** Guitart was considered as a cut-out in FI operation to his uncle, Rene Guitart Rodriguez, residing in Cuba.
*   **Cancellation:** By January 1964, the operational approval was cancelled due to failure to submit PRQ-II and indicate further interest in his operational use.

The documents suggest a cautious approach to using Guitart, involving thorough vetting and security measures before ultimately deciding against his operational deployment.

## Maurice Hyman Halperin: From OSS to Soviet Academic (1955-1976)

These documents trace the career of Maurice Hyman Halperin, revealing his transition from a U.S. government employee to a Soviet academic.

*   **Early Career:** Halperin was a former OSS official during World War II and later a professor at Boston University.
*   **Communist Allegations:** Halperin was linked to Soviet espionage activities, identified by Elizabeth Bentley as a source of information for transmittal to the Soviet Union.
*   **Passport Issues:** After refusing to answer questions about Communist Party membership, Halperin's passport was an issue, later leading to his departure from the U.S.
*   **Mexico and Soviet Union:** Halperin assisted suspected spies in escaping to Czechoslovakia and eventually moved to Moscow, where he became employed by the Soviet Academy of Sciences.
*   **Soviet Academic:** By 1960, Halperin was reported to be working for the Soviet government, advising on Latin American affairs.
*   **Recent Activities (1976):** Halperin was teaching at Simon Fraser University in British Columbia, working on a book about Cuba, and planning an autobiography.
*   **Publications:** Since 1957, Halperin authored books such as "Growth and Crisis in the Latin American Economy," and "The Rise and Decline of Fidel Castro."

Halperin's case illustrates the complex challenges faced by the CIA in dealing with individuals suspected of shifting allegiance to the Soviet Union.

## AELADLE: Handling a Soviet Defector (1961-1976)

These documents concern the handling of a Soviet defector, codenamed AELADLE.

*   **AESTORAGE:** A compilation of information provided by reliable sources, including documentary evidence, regarding AELADLE.
*   **KGB Interrogation:** AELADLE was interrogated by the KGB in Moscow about contacts with the KGB Legal Residency in Helsinki after obtaining a visa at the Soviet Embassy in May 1961.
*   **Defection:** The KGB believed that AELADLE would never be assigned to the United States because a Soviet who defected in Helsinki could identify him.
*   **Concern for German Security:** The CIA considered it inappropriate to act as an intermediary between German services concerning AELADLE, as it involved German security and BFV's information from AELADLE.
*   **Potential Soviet Agent:** AELADLE casually mentioned a KGB officer in Germany who shared his political views but advised Western intelligence to leave him alone.
* **Limited Lead:** The Bonn station requested guidance on whether to query AELADLE about the KGB officer, whose name might have been Akhluyev.
*   **Checking with Soviet Defectors:** In 1976, checks were initiated with Soviet defectors such as Nosenko and AELADLE regarding Wallenberg.

The documents highlight the delicate balance in handling defectors, protecting intelligence sources, and coordinating with allied intelligence agencies.

## Simplified Explanation for Readers Unfamiliar with JFK Files

Okay, imagine these documents are like puzzle pieces that, when put together, tell a story about the CIA's actions during the Cold War. The main focus is on Cuba after Fidel Castro took over and on people who may have switched sides from the US to the Soviet Union, or vice versa.

**Here's a breakdown in simple terms:**

*   **Cuba's Economic Problems:** After Castro's revolution in 1959, Cuba's economy was in bad shape. The CIA was watching closely because they thought this economic trouble could make Cuba turn to the Soviet Union for help, which the US didn't want.
*   **Trying to Sneak People In:** The CIA had plans to sneak people into Cuba. These people were supposed to gather information and maybe cause trouble for Castro's government. One plan was called "Operation JEAN". It was like a spy mission but they had a hard time finding the right people and keeping things secret. The CIA was looking for "self-sufficient personnel".
*   **Agustin Guitart Campuzano:** This man was a Cuban doctor who used to be a government minister. The CIA considered using him to get information from his uncle who still lived in Cuba. They did background checks but eventually decided not to use him. The documentation mentions the FBI was involved in the "security checks".
*   **Maurice Halperin:** This guy is a much bigger deal. He used to work for the US government during World War II but later became a professor. He was accused of being a communist spy and eventually moved to the Soviet Union. The CIA kept track of him as he started working for the Soviet government, writing about Latin America. The documents mention "Elizabeth Bentley" who accused him of being a spy.
*   **AELADLE (A Defector):** Imagine someone who worked for the Soviet government decided to come over to the US side. That's kind of what AELADLE was. The CIA had to be very careful in handling him, getting information from him while protecting their own secrets and working with other countries' intelligence agencies. This person was identified by "KLIMOV", a Soviet embassy employee.

**What's the Big Picture?**

These documents show the CIA was very active in trying to undermine Castro's government in Cuba, and tracking people who were seen as threats or potential double agents during the Cold War. They were trying to gather information, recruit spies, and figure out who they could trust. It's a glimpse into the world of secret operations and the tensions between the US and the Soviet Union.
