# Summary of CIA Documents Regarding Personnel, Covert Operations, and the JFK Assassination Investigation

This summary consolidates information from a collection of classified CIA documents spanning from 1962 to 1977. The documents cover a range of topics including security clearances, cover operations using private firms, personnel actions, and the agency's response to inquiries related to the assassinations of President John F. Kennedy and Martin Luther King Jr.

## I. Personnel Security and Clearances

### A. Boris D. Tarasoff's Security Clearance (March 28, 1963)
This memorandum details the granting of a security clearance to Mr. Boris D. Tarasoff for PCS (Permanent Change of Station) to Mexico City. A key stipulation was that the WHD (likely a division within the CIA) acknowledges that Tarasoff and his family are known to be CIA by USSR representatives due to his prior service as an interpreter/translator in the U.S. The memo notes that Tarasoff was given cover as either a Department of State employee or a U.S. Government Contract Employee during his interpreter/translator duties.

### B. Serasoft, Bares Dimitri (Date Unknown)
This file discusses an inquiry regarding any objections to Dimitri's assignment to a PCS. An initial review of the subject's file revealed no immediate reason to block the processing, but due to Dimitri's background, the final decision was reserved for "Topside," indicating high-level review.

### C. Harold Francis Swenson - Alias Documentation and Reassignment (1962-1965)

*   **Alias Documentation (November 1962):** A request was made for alias documentation for Harold F. Swenson under the alias "Harold Francis Safley." This included a backstopped driver's license. The documents would be used in New York and potentially Latin America.
*   **Reassignment (October 1962):** Harold F. Swenson was reassigned from Buenos Aires, Argentina, to Task Force W and the Office of the Chief. He held the position of Attaché, POL OFF (Political Officer), and OPS OFF (Operations Officer).
*   **Security File Information (July 1, 1965):** Records detail Harold F. Swenson's acquaintances, including Bill Dallgren (CIA/IER), Jack Flynn (CIA/WHD), and Pal Roshiquy (CIA/OTR).
*   **Foreign Intelligence Liaison (May 10, 1965):** Swenson is documented as having contact with Colonel Carlos Luna, the Argentine representative to the Security Committee of the OAS (Organization of American States) in Washington, D.C. These meetings were occasional and covered by a Memorandum of Record.

### D. Guy Vitale Retirement Medallion (February 26, 1969)
The Central Cover Staff was consulted to check for any cover considerations that might impact the release of a retirement medallion to Guy Vitale of the DDP/WH (Directorate of Plans/Western Hemisphere Division). The response indicated no cover objections.

## II. Covert Operations and Support

### A. The Wackenhut Corporation (March 26, 1963)
A memorandum discusses a meeting between a CIA representative and George Wackenhut, President of The Wackenhut Corporation, to explore the firm's potential for providing cover support to the CIA.

*   **Company Overview:** Wackenhut started in 1954 and had grown significantly by 1961. The company had multiple divisions, including Investigative, Scientific Services, Internal Intelligence, Central Clearing, Retail Store Protection, Training Services, Industrial Security, Fire and Safety, and Guard Forces Divisions.
*   **Services:** Wackenhut offered a wide range of services, including investigations, lie detector examinations, security systems, and personnel screening. They also provided security for companies with government classified contracts.
*   **Expansion Plans:** Wackenhut expressed a desire to expand abroad and sought covert sponsorship from the CIA for entry into areas of interest. He was willing to furnish personnel or integrate Agency nominees.
*   **Potential Concerns:** The CIA assessment noted potential difficulties in acquiring occupational permits for Wackenhut's services in foreign countries due to the obvious nature of clandestine intelligence activities. The emphasis on former FBI personnel could raise suspicions, especially in Latin America.
*   **Potential Applications:** The Agency might advise Wackenhut on security system requests from businesses overseas and potentially place an Agency representative in the Wackenhut team. Wackenhut also expressed willingness to provide personal security for foreign chiefs of state.

### B. Military Cover Backstop

*   **Establishment (Date Unknown):** A notification outlines the establishment of a military cover backstop for an employee. This included blocking records, ensuring Army W-2s were issued, and submitting forms for any changes affecting the cover.
*   **Cancellation (Date Unknown):** A subsequent notification indicates the cancellation of the military cover backstop.

## III. The 201 System: Personnel Files

## Explanation for Readers Unfamiliar with the JFK Files:

Okay, imagine you're piecing together a puzzle, but the puzzle pieces are old, dusty documents from the CIA, many of which are marked "SECRET." This summary is like putting the edges of the puzzle together, so you can start to see the picture.

Here's what the documents show, in simpler terms:

1.  **The CIA was very careful about who it hired and where it sent them.** People working for the CIA often had to have "cover stories," like Boris Tarasoff, who had to pretend he worked for the State Department to hide his real job. The CIA also kept detailed files on people, using a system called "201" to track individuals they were interested in. It's like a giant Rolodex of names, activities, and secret information.

2.  **The CIA used private companies to help with secret operations.** One company they considered was called Wackenhut, a security firm. The CIA explored whether Wackenhut could provide cover for their agents overseas, kind of like a disguise for an entire operation.

3.  **The documents touch on the investigation into JFK's assassination.** The summary mentions Lee Harvey Oswald and some people connected to him, as well as the role the CIA played in the investigation. The CIA wanted to make sure that the HSCA - the house committee charged with investigating the assassinations of Kennedy and King - conducted interviews with the correct officials in each country.

4.  **The CIA also took interest in the investigation surrounding Martin Luther King Jr.'s death** This is because James Earl Ray, who was convicted of the crime, may have briefly traveled through Portugal, UK, and Mexico. The CIA wanted to make sure that negotiations and interviews were made by officials who could be publicly quoted, and did not want to involve station officers in negotiations.

In essence, these documents offer a glimpse into the CIA's world of secrets, spies, and complex operations. They show how the agency worked, how it protected its people, and how it responded to major events in history. It's like peeking behind the curtain to see how the intelligence community operated during the Cold War era.
