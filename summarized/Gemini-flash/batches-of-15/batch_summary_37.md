# CIA Activities Regarding Cuban Defectors and Regional Subversion in the 1960s

This summary compiles several classified CIA documents from the 1960s, focusing on Agency activities related to Cuban defectors, the monitoring of communist activities in El Salvador and Guatemala, and the operational challenges and methods used during this period. The documents highlight the CIA's efforts to gather intelligence on communist parties, counter Cuban subversion, and manage relationships with local intelligence services in Central America.

## I. El Salvador: Monitoring Communist Activities and Exploiting Defectors

### A. Recruitment and Intelligence Gathering (September 1964)

*   A CIA asset ("Cuban Target") provided considerable information on communist party activities in El Salvador. This asset arranged Moscow travel for four Salvadorans (Renan Rodas Lazo, Pedro Raul Farsan Medrano, Roberto Armijo Navarrete, and one other whose name could not be recalled).
*   The asset identified key members of the PCES (Communist Party of El Salvador) Central Committee, including Shafick Handal, Jorge Arias Gomez, and Raul Castellanos Figueroa.
*   The PCES was estimated to have 622 members, being well-organized in San Salvador but weak in rural areas.
*   The asset's information was considered substantially true, though he withheld certain details due to concerns about entrapment and personal safety. The CIA agreed to remunerate him and ensure his security.

### B. Handling Roque Dalton's Case (September 1964)

*   Roque Dalton, a known communist, was under arrest and his colleagues were trying to exert pressure on the government for his release, even suggesting expulsion from the country as an alternative to imprisonment.
*   Dalton had been a PCES member since 1955, briefly suspended in 1963 after seeking asylum in Mexico. His explanation for seeking asylum was deemed satisfactory.
*   The CIA planned to interrogate and recruit Dalton, viewing his silence and collaboration as important. His imprisonment would cover recruitment and potentially enhance his value, making him useful outside El Salvador.
*   Efforts were made to move Dalton to a house where a CIA officer could meet him alone, aiming to exploit his knowledge while protecting the CIA's presence and recruitment efforts.

### C. Liaison with Salvadoran Intelligence (September 1964)

*   The CIA briefed the Salvadoran Intelligence Chief on the recruitment of the "Cuban Target," emphasizing its importance and security considerations. The Intelligence Chief agreed that only he and the President would be aware of the recruitment and that no record would be made.
*   The CIA prioritized the "Cuban Target" due to his knowledge of and access to communist parties in El Salvador and Central America.
*   The CIA was cautious about targeting other individuals in El Salvador at the time, except for Dalton, to avoid drawing attention to their presence and recruitment efforts.
*   The Salvadoran Intelligence Chief agreed to handle Dalton's case as the CIA wished.

## II. Guatemala: Briefing on Cuban Subversion and Anti-Castro Sentiment

### A. Briefing Chief of State Peralta (October 1964)

*   A briefing on Cuban subversion was conducted for Guatemalan Chief of State Colonel Peralta, Minister of Government Colonel Serrano, and Intelligence Chief Colonel Porres.
*   The briefing covered the structure and operational techniques of the DGI (Cuban intelligence), its aims, and its operations in Guatemala.
*   The Chief of State Peralta expressed strong anti-Castro sentiments and criticized the U.S. for not taking more aggressive action against Cuba. He also condemned Mexico for its dealings with Cuba.
*   Peralta emphasized the need for a hard line against Cuba, including the use of force, and expressed his determination to "meet violence with violence" against guerrillas in Guatemala.
*   The case of a Mexican courier working for Cuban intelligence and detained in Guatemala was referenced.
*   Peralta accepted security restrictions and agreed to limit the information to those present.

### B. Dalton's Potential Transfer (October 1964)

*   The possibility of transferring Dalton to Guatemala was discussed, contingent on the request of President Rivera of El Salvador or Colonel Medrano.
*   If Dalton were transferred, CIA personnel would likely interact with him in Guatemala.

## III. Operational Challenges and Methods

### A. Security Concerns and Liaison Management

*   The documents reveal a constant concern about maintaining operational security and compartmentalization of information.
*   The CIA sought to balance the need for cooperation with local intelligence services and the risk of exposing sensitive operations.
*   There was a tension between the desire to maintain unilateral control of operations and the need to inform host governments to ensure their cooperation.

### B. Covert Operations and Technical Support

*   The documents allude to covert operations aimed at gathering intelligence on communist activities and countering Cuban subversion.
*   The CIA provided technical support, including photographic equipment and expertise, to enhance the capabilities of local assets.
*   Various projects (LILYRIC, BICAL, LIONION, KDAFGHAN) involved the use of specialized equipment for surveillance and intelligence gathering.

## IV. KDAFGHAN Project: Technical Support and Surveillance

### A. Surveillance Equipment and Technical Issues

*   The KDAFGHAN project involved photographic operations, requiring specialized equipment such as catadioptric lenses and cameras.
*   Technical challenges included space limitations for equipment and the need for compact, lightweight systems.
*   The project utilized Balscope lenses, Exakta and Pentax cameras, and other photographic equipment.

### B. Passport Management and Security

*   The CIA managed passports for KDAFGHAN operatives (LIONION-1 and LIONION-2) to facilitate their travel.
*   Security measures included the use of true-name pouches for transporting sensitive documents.
*   Compromised cryptonyms led to changes in project names to maintain secrecy.

### C. Technical Support and Development

*   Technical support was provided by KURIOT Headquarters, including repairs and replacements for cameras and film magazines.
*   The development of a small battery charger for the pulse camera system demonstrated the resourcefulness of CIA technicians.
*   The CIA sought to optimize film processing techniques to improve the quality of photographic intelligence.

## V. Personnel and Asset Management

### A. Recruitment and Handling of Assets

*   The recruitment and handling of assets like the "Cuban Target" required careful management to ensure their safety and continued cooperation.
*   Concerns about entrapment and security leaks were paramount in these relationships.

### B. Liaison with Local Authorities

*   **Using "Defectors":** Sometimes, people who used to be involved with the Cuban government (called "defectors") would give the CIA information. The CIA thought these people could help them understand what Cuba was up to.
*   **Working with Local Governments:** The CIA worked with the governments of El Salvador and Guatemala to share information and try to stop the communists. However, they had to be careful about what they told these governments, because they didn't want to reveal too many secrets.
*   **Roque Dalton:** One person mentioned a lot is Roque Dalton. He was a communist the CIA was very interested in and was under arrest, they considered trying to get him on their side.
*   **Secret Equipment:** The CIA used a lot of cameras, lenses, and other equipment to spy on people. They even had secret code names for these projects, like "KDAFGHAN" and "LIONION." They had to make sure this equipment was working properly and that nobody found out about it.

**Why Does This Matter?**

These documents show how the CIA was trying to influence what was happening in Central America during the Cold War. They were using secret methods to gather information and try to stop communism from spreading. It gives us a peek into a hidden part of history. The CIA was very concerned with Cuban subversion and were trying to contain the spread of communism in the region.
