# Covert Operations and Personnel Management within the CIA: A Compilation of Declassified Documents

This summary compiles declassified CIA documents shedding light on various aspects of the agency's covert operations, personnel management, and security protocols during the Cold War era, particularly focusing on the period between 1950 and the early 1960s. These documents provide insights into the use of aliases, cover identities, agent recruitment, security clearances, and interactions with other government agencies.

## I. Establishing and Managing Cover Identities

*   **Official Documentation for Cover Identities:** A May 8, 1963 memorandum details a request for a U.S. Army Investigator Credential and Civilian Identification Card in the alias of "Balmes N. HIDALGO, Jr." (True name "Bernard Forman HILLARY"). The request, initiated by SAS (likely Support Activities Staff), specified that the credential would be used generally in the Southeastern part of the United States and possibly in Latin America in pursuit of the mission of SAS. The utilization of the credential was to be on a controlled basis as directed by the Chief of Station, JMWAVE. Balmes Hidalgo's date of birth is listed as May 27, 1919, with Social Security Number 055-18-4137.

*   **Military Cover Backstop:** A notification dated April 5, 1964, confirms the establishment of a military cover backstop for "HIDALCO, Palmes N., Jr." within an Army Element, identified as "(Joint Operations Group)." This cover was established on a continuing basis, indicating a longer-term assignment. The document references file number K-7412 and a request for cover dated April 9, 1964, suggesting ongoing management of Hidalgo's cover identity. The establishment of the military cover backstop was handled by James A. Franklin, Chief, Military Cover, CCO.

*   **Changing Alias Documentation:** A memorandum dated August 15, 1962, references a previous request for alias documentation for "HILLARY, Bernard N." and notes the return of a New York State driver's license, a National Rifle Association of America card, and a USF&d card. The memo requests the creation of new documentation, including a Virginia driver's license, with an Arlington, Virginia address, suggesting a shift in Hillary's operational base or role.

## II. Agent Recruitment and Assessment

*   **REDSKIN Agent Program:** A series of memoranda from February 1961 describe a proposal for assessing potential "REDSKIN Agents." Initial plans involved using "TSD's Psychological Assessment Associates" firm. However, due to concerns raised by CCG (Counterintelligence Contact Group), an alternative cover organization was sought. The documents suggest using the "EMPLOYMENT SERVICE COMPANY" in Pittsburgh, managed by Margaret A. KEARNEY, as an initial assessment firm. Two OTR (likely Office of Training) psychologists, Doctors BRADT and McKEF, would be documented with the firm in true name. Furthermore, Howard OSBORE, Deputy Chief, SR Division, desired that all training and assessment be conducted outside of Washington, D.C., with training in a New York safe house and final assessment potentially in Baltimore. SR Division planned to process thirty to thirty-five REDSKIN Agents in 1961.

## III. Security Clearances and Personnel Management

*   **Security Approval for Overseas Assignment:** A December 2, 1960 memo discusses "Hidalgo, Balines N. Jr.," noting that a request for security approval for State Department certification had been secured for a 30-day TOY (Temporary Operational Year) to San Salvador. While Hidalgo's file was non-derogatory, he was a former FBI informant, and the State Department appeared reluctant to consider him for integration in 1957.

*   **Semi-Covert Employee Integration:** A December 14, 1950 memorandum details the case of "John F. RITTENHOUSE," whose security clearance was canceled. The decision was made to consider Rittenhouse a semi-covert employee integrated into the Department of the Army rather than deep cover.

*   **Cross-Referencing Personnel Files:** A confidential memo dated August 2, 1960, lists multiple individuals cross-referenced in personnel security files. This suggests an attempt to identify relationships or connections between individuals for security purposes. People connected to "GETHULE L. CULLY DUPFEY" were cross-referenced with names such as "THAI JOSEPH BURKE", "STRANT L. BTT", and "CLIRE LOUTH LUCE".

*   **Removal of CIA Building Passes:** A December 16, 1958 memorandum requests the removal of CIA building passes for members and alternate members of the Inter-agency Defector Committee, including Army personnel Mrs. Dorothea K. Matlack and Major Earnest E. Livaditis, as well as Air Force personnel Major Warren B. Reid and Colonel Jas T. Bull. The note requests to add 1717 H Street Building access to two passes.

*   **Travel Briefing Data:** A document details travel briefing data for an individual with file number 70418, rank GS-15, and TCS (likely Temporary Committee Staff) status, using cover 32 AID (Agency for International Development). The briefing covered various security regulations, travel precautions, personal affairs, conduct, and potential hostile audio surveillance.

*   **Accommodation Addresses:** A November 17, 1961 memorandum requests the cancellation of accommodation addresses for several individuals, including Andrew L. JACKOLDOW, David S. MORALES, Charles A. BERTELLI, Jacob SACKLOVE, Harold HAMILTON, Bernard Alvin PARKS, and others. This suggests a review or restructuring of operational infrastructure.

## IV. Specific Operations and Projects

*   **RYBAT FJDUST - CJ MIL/1 - Damage Report:** A dispatch from Vientiane details concerns about "Barry CYFRAIL/L" potentially receiving sensitive information from a CIA operative. It notes that CYFRAIL/L resided in Pottstown, Pennsylvania, and hoped to work for R.C.A. on a classified project in the Caribbean. The dispatch identifies several WOFIRM personnel whom the operative introduced to CYFRAIL/1.

*   **Project Personnel List:** A document dated July 26, 1962, lists personnel involved in projects "(AEROOT)" and "(CAMBARO)," detailing their functions, such as Case Officer (Charles P. DEXTER, Clarence E. HOWARD), Audio Surveillance (Bernard EDGECOMB), Photo Instructor (John FELLY, John FIBLE), and Firearms Instructor (Hampton HOWARD).

## V. Summary and Implications

These declassified documents paint a picture of the CIA's intricate operations during the Cold War. The use of aliases, cover identities, and complex recruitment processes highlights the clandestine nature of the agency's work. The documents reveal the agency's attention to detail in managing its personnel, ensuring security, and maintaining operational secrecy. The specific operations and projects mentioned, such as the REDSKIN agent program and the concerns about potential information leaks, underscore the risks and challenges faced by the CIA in its efforts to gather intelligence and conduct covert actions.

The creation and maintenance of cover identities like that of Balmes N. HIDALGO, Jr./Bernard Forman HILLARY demonstrate the lengths to which the CIA went to protect its operatives and their activities. The security protocols, including background checks, travel briefings, and the management of accommodation addresses, highlight the agency's commitment to safeguarding classified information and mitigating risks.

The documentation of initiatives like the REDSKIN agent program sheds light on the agency's methods for recruiting and assessing potential agents, as well as the complex decision-making processes involved in selecting appropriate cover organizations and training locations. The interagency cooperation, as seen in the Inter-agency Defector Committee and the liaison with the State Department, underscores the collaborative nature of intelligence gathering and national security efforts during this period. These documents collectively provide valuable insights into the inner workings of the CIA and its role in shaping the Cold War landscape.

## VI. Simplified Explanation for a Reader Unfamiliar with JFK Files

Okay, imagine the CIA during the Cold War as a giant spy network working in the shadows. These documents are like snippets from their internal memos and files, giving us a peek into how they operated.

Think of it like this:

*   **Creating Fake Identities:** A lot of the work involved creating believable "cover stories" for their agents. The documents show them requesting fake IDs, like driver's licenses and even Army credentials, under made-up names. For example, "Balmes N. HIDALGO, Jr." was actually "Bernard Forman HILLARY" using a fake name to do secret work, possibly in Latin America. They even made sure these fake identities had records in the system so if someone checked, it would seem real.

*   **Recruiting Spies:** They were always looking for new people to work for them. One program, called "REDSKIN," involved finding and training potential agents. They used different methods to assess these candidates, sometimes even using fake employment agencies to check them out before revealing they were with the CIA.

*   **Keeping Secrets:** Security was a HUGE deal. They were constantly checking people's backgrounds, tracking who knew who, and even canceling building access passes for people who no longer needed them. They also gave agents strict instructions on how to travel, what to say, and who to talk to in order to avoid getting caught.

*   **Specific Missions:** Some documents hint at specific missions, like one involving a woman who might have been exposed to sensitive information. They were worried about the damage she could do, so they investigated.

In short, these documents show the CIA carefully crafting fake identities, recruiting potential spies, and taking extreme measures to keep their operations secret during a time of high tension with the Soviet Union. The main goal was information gathering, counter intelligence, and covert operations.
