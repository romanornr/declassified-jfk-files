# Unraveling the Shadows: A Synthesis of FBI and CIA Interactions, Anti-Castro Efforts, and Internal Security Concerns (1953-1967)

This document provides a cohesive summary of various FBI and CIA documents, shedding light on their interactions, internal security concerns, and efforts related to anti-Castro activities during the period from 1953 to 1967. It elucidates the intricate relationships between these agencies, the surveillance of individuals deemed potential threats, and the complexities of managing information from sensitive sources.

## I. FBI-CIA Cooperation and Conflicts

### A. Establishing Lines of Communication (1953-1967)

The documents reveal a complex dynamic between the FBI and CIA, characterized by both cooperation and conflict. The establishment of a formal liaison with James Angleton, Chief of Counterintelligence at the CIA, in 1953 marked a significant step in fostering communication between the two agencies.

*   **James Angleton as a Key Source:** Angleton, in charge of the Special Projects unit within the CIA's Foreign Intelligence division, provided the FBI with valuable information, often bypassing regular CIA channels. This information included raw intelligence reports from various sources, including the Israeli Intelligence Service, Jay Lovestone of the American Federation of Labor, and intelligence services in France, Italy, Greece, and Great Britain.
*   **Bureau Informant 100:** To protect Angleton's identity, the FBI designated him as "Bureau Informant 100." This allowed the FBI to disseminate Angleton's information without revealing its source, crucial for maintaining the integrity of sensitive projects.
*   **Formalizing Communication:** Angleton began providing blank memoranda with control numbers to the FBI liaison agent to standardize the dissemination of information. This system ensured efficient tracking and reference of intelligence shared between the agencies.

### B. Navigating Internal Conflicts and Policy Disagreements (1963)

Despite the collaborative efforts, internal conflicts and policy disagreements strained the relationship between the FBI and CIA. A 1963 memo highlights specific instances of discord:

*   **Delayed Notification of Cuban Intelligence Agent:** The CIA's failure to promptly notify the FBI about a Cuban exile who confessed to being trained as a Cuban intelligence agent led to significant friction.
*   **Disagreement over Technical Coverage:** A dispute arose over the FBI's technical coverage of diplomatic establishments in the U.S., with the CIA Director, John McCone, initially disputing statements attributed to him. This conflict was resolved only after McCone admitted that his subordinates had erroneously briefed the FBI.
*   **McCone's Perspective:** McCone was portrayed as ambitious, viewing himself as "the Director of Central Intelligence" rather than simply the head of the CIA. He relied heavily on intelligence gathered through technical means like high-altitude photography, which, while effective, underscored the need for human intelligence sources.
*   **Areas of Cooperation:** Despite these conflicts, the FBI and CIA collaborated on numerous fronts, including sharing information from sensitive sources like "Tophat" (penetration of the Soviet Military Intelligence Service) and "Gimme" (penetration of the Czech Intelligence Service).

### C. Evolving Protocols and Streamlining Processes (1966-1967)

Over time, the FBI and CIA adapted their protocols to improve efficiency and security. By 1967, the FBI found that maintaining a separate control file for information received from James Angleton was no longer necessary.

*   **Redundancy in Filing:** The information Angleton provided was already filed in individual case files, making the control file redundant.
*   **Streamlining Operations:** The FBI discontinued the practice of keeping separate copies of Bureau Informant 100 material, while still maintaining the informant designation and its associated protocols.

## II. Monitoring Threats and Maintaining Internal Security

### A. Identifying Potential Threats to National Security (1964)

The FBI actively monitored individuals who were considered potential threats to national security, including those traveling to and from sensitive regions.

*   **Review of Individuals in Switzerland and Austria:** In December 1964, the FBI reviewed files in Bern to identify individuals in Switzerland and Austria who might pose a threat to the President. They found no one fitting this category.
*   **Inquiries with Covert CIA Operatives:** The FBI discreetly inquired with covert CIA operatives and security officers in Bern and Vienna, but none had knowledge of potential threats.
*   **Paul George Anderson:** Attention was drawn to Paul George Anderson, who frequently traveled to Hungary, as he was of interest to the Secret Service.

### B. Surveillance of Mark Lane (1964)

Mark Lane, an individual of interest, was also subjected to scrutiny by the FBI.

*   **Dissemination of Security Information:** Security information concerning Mark Lane was disseminated to Austrian and Swiss security police, as well as U.S. Consulates and the covert CIA in Vienna.
*   **Notification Protocols:** These agencies were instructed to notify the FBI if Lane came to their attention.

### C. Addressing Internal Security Breaches (1963-1966)

The documents also address concerns about internal security breaches and potential espionage.

*   **Jack Edward Dunlap Case:** The case of Jack Edward Dunlap, a National Security Agency employee who supplied information to the Soviets and later committed suicide, raised serious concerns. The FBI shared information with McCone about Dunlap's activities and the potential compromise of CIA sources like Oleg Penkovsky.
*   **Joachim Joesten Threat:** In August 1966, the FBI was alerted to a letter from Joachim Joesten, postmarked from Milan, Italy. The letter contained threatening language against the "Johnson gang," prompting the dissemination of this information to the White House and Secret Service.

## III. Anti-Castro Activities and Cuban Intelligence

### A. Monitoring Anti-Castro Groups (1967)

The FBI closely monitored anti-Castro groups and individuals involved in Cuban affairs, often collaborating with the CIA.

*   **Jorge Raul Roblejo Lorie:** The FBI investigated Jorge Raul Roblejo Lorie, focusing on his involvement with the Comite Pro-Liberacion de los Cien (CPLLC), or Committee for the Liberation of the One Hundred.
*   **Sergio Oswaldo Betancourt Collazo:** Sergio Oswaldo Betancourt Collazo, a former General Coordinator of the 30th of November anti-Castro organization, provided information to the FBI about Roblejo's activities. Betancourt's employment at the Cuban Refugee Processing Center allowed him access to sensitive information, which Roblejo attempted to exploit.
*   **Suspicion of Roblejo's Motives:** Betancourt suspected Roblejo of being anti-United States and a "leftist-socialist." Roblejo's detailed questioning about the processing of Cuban refugees and his request to photograph documents raised concerns about his true intentions.
*   **Roblejo's Travel Plans:** Roblejo's plans to travel to Venezuela, Panama, and Ottawa, Canada, and his interest in obtaining a Mexican visa to visit Cuba, were of particular interest to the FBI.

### B. CIA's Operational Interests and Involvement (1961-1962)

The CIA had significant operational interests in anti-Castro activities, often intersecting with the FBI's investigations.

*   **Santiago Alvarez Rodriguez:** The CIA had an operational interest in Santiago Alvarez Rodriguez and his son during the Cuban invasion in April 1961. Although the CIA's direct interest in Alvarez waned, they maintained interest in his son and his yacht, the "Alisan."
*   **Malone's Conversations with CIA Contacts:** Michael J. P. Malone, connected to the King Ranch, provided memoranda of his conversations with CIA contacts regarding Cuban matters. These conversations revealed differing opinions within the U.S. government about President Kennedy's plans for Cuba.
*   **Differing Perspectives on U.S. Action in Cuba:** Malone's contacts within the CIA indicated that a plan was in development to address the Cuban situation, but Vice President Johnson suggested that President Kennedy was primarily focused on other global issues like Berlin and Vietnam.

### C. Information Gathering and Source Management (1962)

The FBI gathered information from various sources to assess the political climate and potential actions related to Cuba.

*   **Contacting Key Figures:** Malone and his associates were encouraged to discuss the Cuban question with Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy and Senators Hubert Humphrey and McCarthy.
*   **Romualdi's Assessment:** Serafino Romualdi of the AFL-CIO believed that President Kennedy was being influenced by advisors who favored a softer line on Cuba, but that some officials were recognizing the need for a firmer policy.

## Conclusion

The documents collectively paint a picture of the complex interplay between the FBI and CIA during a critical period in history. The agencies navigated internal conflicts while collaborating on essential national security objectives, including monitoring potential threats, maintaining internal security, and addressing the challenges posed by anti-Castro activities and Cuban intelligence operations. The detailed surveillance, information sharing protocols, and the management of sensitive sources underscore the intricate efforts to safeguard U.S. interests during the Cold War era. The insights from these documents highlight the dynamic relationships, strategic priorities, and operational complexities that shaped the intelligence landscape of the time.

## JFK Files Summary for Layman Understanding

Imagine the FBI and CIA as two branches of the US government working to keep the country safe during the Cold War. These documents reveal how they worked together (and sometimes clashed) to deal with threats from both inside and outside the US, especially those related to Cuba and the Soviet Union.

**What are these documents about?**

These papers, which were once classified, offer a peek into how the FBI and CIA operated from the 1950s to the late 1960s. They cover a few key themes:

*   **FBI and CIA Relationships:** The documents show that the FBI and CIA sometimes worked hand-in-hand, sharing information and resources. But there were also moments of conflict and disagreement, mainly over how to handle sensitive information and who should be in charge.

*   **Keeping an Eye on Potential Threats:** During the Cold War, the FBI and CIA were vigilant about monitoring people they thought could be a threat to the US. This included tracking people traveling to and from countries like Russia and Cuba and investigating individuals suspected of being spies.

*   **Dealing with Cuba:** After Fidel Castro took power in Cuba, the US government was very concerned about the situation. The documents show the FBI and CIA monitoring anti-Castro groups, trying to figure out what the US government should do about Cuba and working with informants close to President Kennedy to pressure the president to be tougher on Cuba.

*   **Internal Security:** These documents show examples of the agencies responding to leaks and checking the backgrounds of staff in Government.

**Key takeaways:**

*   **James Angleton:** Angleton played a vital role because he passed on intelligence from outside channels. This was risky but also helpful.

*   **Conflicts:** McCone did not see eye to eye with the director and pushed back on authority.

*   **Informants:** The agencies depended on informants. Many of these informants worked close to Castro and close to Kennedy.
