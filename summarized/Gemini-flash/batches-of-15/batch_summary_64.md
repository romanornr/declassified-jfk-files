## Shadows of Doubt: Intrigue and Instability in South Vietnam, 1963

This summary compiles several classified CIA documents from September and October 1963, revealing a complex web of coup plotting, political maneuvering, and internal anxieties within South Vietnam's Diem regime. These documents, originally classified and not fully released until 2025 under the JFK Assassination Records Act, paint a picture of a government on the brink, grappling with internal dissent, external pressures, and the ever-present threat of communist insurgency.

### Escalating Coup Plots Against the Diem Regime

The documents reveal persistent coup plotting against President Ngo Dinh Diem.

*   **General Nguyen Khanh's Hesitation (September 19, 1963):** A CIA telegram dated September 19, 1963, indicates that Brigadier General Nguyen Khanh was contemplating action against the Diem regime but was hesitant without assurances of U.S. support. According to a staff officer on Khanh's staff, Khanh was evaluating whether to proceed with plans to take action against the Diem regime and had changed his mind to mull the situation over for another week. The report suggests Khanh's potential involvement, although he needed guarantees from the United States to initiate any decisive action.
*   **Pham Ngoc Thao and the Tuyen Group (September 21, 1963):** A separate telegram from September 21, 1963, highlights the activities of Pham Ngoc Thao, a strategic hamlet inspector for Ngo Dinh Nhu, and his involvement with the Tuyen Group. According to a Vietnamese nationalist source, the group was planning a coup d'Ã©tat to oust the Ngo family, scheduled for the week beginning September 22, 1963. The report also suggests that Generals Duong Van Minh and Le Van Kim were involved in the plans. It suggests Brigadier General Nguyen Khanh would move on Hue at the same time that Thao launched his move in Saigon.
*   **Huynh Van Lang's Plans (September 24, 1963):** A CIA telegram from September 24, 1963, details the coup plans of Huynh Van Lang, a professor of economics at Saigon University. Lang indicated that his coup group aimed to launch a coup before October 5, possibly on September 26 or 28. The Revolutionary Committee included Generals Tran Thien Khiem, Nguyen Khanh, and Duong Van Minh. The group claimed to have multiple divisions ready to participate and had considered the challenges of breaching the bunker where President Diem might hide.
*   **Lang's Governmental Planning (October 2, 1963):** A CIA telegram from October 2, 1963, focuses on Lang's coup group further planning. Lt. General Le Van Ty reinforced the generals' demands for governmental reforms. Brigadier General Tran Thien Khiem was concerned about Viet Cong military activity near Saigon. The coup plotters wanted to be assured of U.S. support. Colonel Do Mau was trying to influence VNAF Officers to attack Gia Long Palace.
*   **The Generals' Demands (October 8, 1963):** As of October 5, 1963, the generals were pressing President Diem for a response to demands made during the martial law phase. These demands included military men holding ministerial positions and control over Saigon police, actions that would amount to a surrender by Diem and Nhu. The report suggests that Diem and Nhu would likely engage in time-consuming negotiations to deter a coup and monitor any potential combinations.

### Internal Instability and Repression

These documents shed light on the internal atmosphere within South Vietnam.

*   **Atmosphere of Fear and Uncertainty (October 8, 1963):** Despite the regime's attempts to project normalcy, the atmosphere in Saigon was pervaded by fear and uncertainty. Arrests and searches of private homes by security forces continued, contributing to a sense of instability.
*   **Buddhist Crisis and Government Response (October 4, 1963):** One document, dated October 4, 1963, details the planned suicide of Dieu Hue, the mother of Vietnamese scientist Buu Hoi, to protest the persecution of Buddhism in Vietnam. She planned to distribute a letter denouncing her son and claiming Buddhism was still being persecuted in Vietnam.
*   **Regime's Plans for National Day (October 8, 1963):** There were indications that the GVN was planning surprises for the October 26 National Day celebrations. Nhu allegedly mentioned an unspecified economic and social action that would displease both the wealthy and the Americans, and changes in the police and civil intelligence complex were expected.
*   **Plans to Assassinate Ambassador Lodge (October 9, 1963):** A CIA information report revealed the GVN's plans to allow a student demonstration in front of the American Embassy, under which GVN agents would attack the embassy, assassinate Ambassador Henry Cabot Lodge and other officials, and burn the Chancery.

### U.S. Involvement and Concerns

The documents reveal the United States' awareness of the instability and coup plotting.

*   **U.S. Awareness of Coup Planning (September 1963):** The reports highlight that U.S. intelligence was well-informed about the coup planning, the individuals involved, and their motivations.
*   **U.S. Policy on Coups (October 30, 1963):** A message from McGeorge Bundy at the White House to Ambassador Lodge, dated October 30, 1963, outlines U.S. policy regarding the coup. It states that the U.S. does not accept that it has no power to delay or discourage a coup, emphasizing that Lodge should persuade coup leaders to desist if the operation did not have a high prospect of success. It authorized Lodge to make clandestine disbursements to the coup group.

### Recommendations for Ngo Dinh Nhu as Prime Minister

*   **Cabinet Officers' Recommendation (October 15, 1963):** Cabinet Officers recommended to President Diem that Ngo Dinh Nhu be appointed Prime Minister. A constitutional amendment would be required, which would easily be passed by the National Assembly.

### Early Assessments of the Situation in Southeast Asia (July 11, 1962)

These documents, much earlier than October 1963, provide a helpful foundation of the state of affairs in South East Asia and in Viet Nam in particular.

*   **Overall Evaluation:** The general trend in Viet-Nam appeared slightly favorable, with the GVN continuing to improve its military position and to a limited extent, its political and economic position. The Viet Cong showed no weakening in strength or determination despite reportedly heavy losses. Fearing that the prospective Lae settlement would facilitate Viet Cong activities and that it might presage a U. S. move to neutralize Viet-Nam itself, the GVN had made difficulties at Geneva over several issues and threatened to boycott the conference.
*   **Thailand:** On July 2 the US began the redeployment of 1,000 Merines from the Third Marine Expeditionary Brigade at Udorn. The Thai have agreed to the proposal in principle to improve logistic facilities in Thailand.
*   **Laos:** The principal remaining issues before the Geneva Conference, including SEATO, having been resolved, it was anticipated that the new Accords may be signed next week. There was nevertheless one serious stumbling block, which endangers the satisfactory conclusion of the Conference, i.e., the possible refusal of the GVN to sign.
*   **Burma:** The internal situation remains unstable.
*   **Cambodia:** Cambodia's differences with neighboring Thailand and South Viet-Nam continue, but they have so far not significantly affected the presently generally satisfactory relations between the United States and Cambodia.

### Analysis of Potential Effect of Kennedy Assassination on East-West Relations (December 1963)

After Kennedy's assassination, the CIA sought to understand the potential implications of that event on East-West relations.

*   **Soviet Bloc and Yugoslavian Diplomatic Reaction (December 6, 1963):** A CIA telegram dated December 6, 1963, reports on the comments of Yugoslav and Soviet Bloc diplomats in Athens regarding the assassination of President Kennedy. The diplomats expressed concerns that the assassination would delay improved East-West relations, highlighting Kennedy's developed contacts with Soviet leadership and the need for President Johnson to establish similar trust.
*   **Hope and Concern (November 1963):** Yugoslav Ambassador Peko Dapcevic expressed hope that the assassination would not change the international atmosphere, and he suggested the Soviet Union was well disposed to continue friendly contacts with West. Czech First Secretary Vaklav Svestka stated that US policy would not change materially, however he suggested Kennedy had developed contacts with Soviet leadership and achieved acceptance of Sovbloc populations as a peace-loving man, and Johnson has to establish this for himself now. Soviet First Secretary Vitaliy Novikov stated that Soviets do not expect immediate change in US foreign policies, however the assassination clearly showed radical right-wing elements are strong.

### Castro, Brizola, and China

*   **Offer of Support (September 3, 1961):** During the week of 27 August Party Chairman Mao Tse Tung of Communist China and Premier Fidel Castro of Cuba both offered material support, including quote volunteers unquote, to Leonel Brizola, Governor of Rio Grande do Sul, who was leading the struggle in Brazil to assure the succession to the presidency of Vice President Joao Goulart upon the resignation of President Janio Quadros.

### Conclusion

These documents underscore the precariousness of the Diem regime in South Vietnam during the fall of 1963. The constant coup plotting, internal repression, and the complex interplay of international interests created a highly volatile environment. The United States, while ostensibly supporting Diem, was clearly aware of his weaknesses and the potential for a change in leadership. The assassination of President Kennedy added another layer of uncertainty, raising questions about the future direction of U.S. policy in the region. The classified documents reveal the intricate and often duplicitous nature of international politics during the Cold War and shed light on the critical decisions that shaped the course of the Vietnam War.

## Understanding the JFK Files on Vietnam (Simplified for New Readers)

Okay, imagine you're trying to understand a really complicated TV show where everyone's got secrets and is plotting against each other. These JFK files are kind of like that, but it's real life and it's about the situation in South Vietnam back in 1963. Here's a breakdown to help you follow along:

**The Main Players:**

*   **South Vietnam:** This country was fighting a war against communist North Vietnam. The US was supporting South Vietnam.
*   **Ngo Dinh Diem:** He was the President of South Vietnam. The US supported Diem. However, many people, even within his own government, were unhappy with him.
*   **Ngo Dinh Nhu:** Diem's brother and close advisor. He was even more disliked than Diem, seen as manipulative and power-hungry.
*   **The Generals:** High-ranking military officers in the South Vietnamese army. They were getting frustrated with Diem's leadership.
*   **The US (United States):** The US was giving money, weapons, and advisors to South Vietnam to help them fight the communists. However, the US was also getting worried about Diem and whether he was the right leader.
*   **Henry Cabot Lodge:** The US Ambassador to South Vietnam. He was responsible for representing US interests there.

**What's Going On (The Plot):**

*   **Coup Plots:** Many people in South Vietnam, especially the generals, were secretly planning to overthrow Diem. They thought he was a bad leader and was losing the war against the communists.
*   **US Involvement:** The US knew about these coup plots. They were trying to decide whether to support the coup or stick with Diem. The big question was whether Diem was making the entire effort of war with North Vietnam a wasted cause.
*   **Internal Problems:** South Vietnam had lots of internal problems. There was a religious crisis (Diem was Catholic and discriminated against Buddhists). There was also corruption and a lack of freedom.
*   **Fear and Uncertainty:** The atmosphere in South Vietnam was tense. People were afraid of the government and didn't know what was going to happen next.
*   **The Kennedy Assassination:** Then, President Kennedy was assassinated in November of 1963. This made everything even more uncertain, as people wondered how the new US president, Lyndon B. Johnson, would handle the situation in Vietnam.

**What the Documents Show:**

*   **Secret Plans:** The documents reveal that the CIA knew about all the coup plots. They were gathering information on who was involved, what their plans were, and how likely they were to succeed.
*   **US Doubts:** The documents show that the US government had serious doubts about Diem. They were worried that he was out of touch with the people and that his government was corrupt and oppressive.
*   **Moral Considerations:** Some were willing to depose an existing, but weak, leader, in favor of someone who was more agreeable to US policy in the region.
*   **Dangerous Decisions:** The documents highlight the difficult decisions the US was facing. Should they support a coup, even if it meant betraying a leader they had been supporting? Or should they stick with Diem, even if it meant risking the war against communism?

**In Simple Terms:**

Basically, South Vietnam was a mess. The US was trying to help, but they were also dealing with a leader (Diem) who was unpopular and possibly incompetent. The whole situation was a powder keg waiting to explode, and the Kennedy assassination only made things more dangerous. These documents give us a glimpse into the secret plans and difficult choices that were being made behind the scenes. It's a real-life political drama with high stakes.
