# The CIA's Covert Operations in Cuba and Latin America: A Summary of Classified Documents

This summary synthesizes multiple classified CIA documents, shedding light on the agency's covert operations, intelligence gathering, and propaganda efforts related to Cuba and Latin America, particularly during the early to mid-1960s. The documents reveal the intricate networks of agents, assets, and informants used to gather information, influence media narratives, and destabilize the Cuban government under Fidel Castro.

## JMWAVE's Relationship with the Media: AMCARBON-1 and Propaganda

One key area of focus involves the CIA's relationship with media outlets in South Florida, specifically through an asset identified as AMCARBON-1. This relationship was cultivated by JMWAVE, a CIA station involved in covert operations against Cuba.

*   **Context:** JMWAVE aimed to establish relationships with major South Florida news media to ensure that sensitive KUBARK (CIA) activities in the region would not be exposed.
*   **AMCARBON-1:** He worked for an entity referred to as "Identity 3" (identified as *The Miami Herald* in a separate attachment) and held a significant position as the "Identity 4" (Latin American Editor).
*   **Operational Framework:** AMCARBON-1 agreed to bring potentially embarrassing information about KUBARK to REUTEMAN's (JMWAVE contact) attention for guidance on how to handle it, ensuring both the security of CIA operations and the journalistic reputation of the *Miami Herald*.
*   **Information Exchange:** In exchange for AMCARBON-1's cooperation, REUTEMAN would provide steering tips on fast-breaking news stories, without providing classified information.
*   **Operational Support:** AMCARBON-1 was used to carry out operational support tasks within the context of his normal journalistic activities, such as locating individuals for debriefing (e.g., Andrew ORDONO Camps) and discrediting problematic figures like Carlos BANDIN of the MRR Splinter Group.
*   **Intelligence Gathering:** AMCARBON-1 provided operational intelligence, including information on the movements of AMBEND-1, the *Miami Herald*'s interest in the Bay of Pigs invasion, and the presence of journalists researching sensitive topics.
*   **Propaganda Outlet:** AMCARBON-1 was used as a propaganda outlet to surface items of interest to KUBARK in the press. Examples include the AMCRAB-1 defection story, the Charles GRIFFIN shrimp boat story, and coverage of the LAYC meeting in Santiago, Chile.
*   **Assessment:** AMCARBON-1 was considered honest, cooperative, and security-conscious. JMWAVE planned to continue using him, believing the relationship enhanced their operational security and minimized potential conflicts with media outlets in South Florida.

## AMCUTLER-1: KUTUBE Operations, Courier Channels, and Maritime Expeditions

The documents also detail the activities of another asset, AMCUTLER-1, focusing on KUTUBE operations (likely a specific type of covert action) and efforts to establish courier channels into Cuba.

*   **Focus:** AMCUTLER-1's efforts were directed toward supporting the AMTAUNA operation (another covert project) and developing new KUTUBE operations.
*   **AMTAUNA Support:** He investigated AMFAUNA-4 and explored a potential courier channel to AMTAUNA-1 using Brazilian citizens Gonzalo and Manuel ARELEM Martin, who worked for the Brazilian Consulate in Miami and the Brazilian Embassy in Havana, respectively.
*   **KUTUBE Development:** AMCUTLER-1 followed up leads, interviewing individuals like Carlos Manuel CACERES-Blay and Evelio CRUZ to gather intelligence reports and operational information on caves near Trinidad, Cuba.
*   **Potential Defector:** AMCUTLER-1 reported that Dr. Carlos PEDEMONTE, head of the Cartographic Office of INRA in Cuba, was seeking a way to leave the country.
*   **Maritime Expedition:** AMCUTLER-1 was invited to join a maritime expedition against tanker traffic on the south coast of Cuba, with the objective of seizing a Cuban frigate.
*   **Weapons Sale:** AMCUTLER-1 reported that individuals named Reinard LOPEZ Llub and Enrique CEIJAS offered to sell weapons allegedly belonging to KUBARK.

## AMFAUNA-14: Infiltration, Interrogation, and Double-Agent Recruitment

Another significant aspect covered in the documents is the story of AMFAUNA-14, detailing her role as a cutout in Cuba, her arrest by the DSE (Cuban intelligence), and her subsequent interrogation and recruitment as a potential double agent.

*   **Role as a Cutout:** AMFAUNA-14 served as a communications link between AMCOG-2 and an agent named Luis Braulio VILLAR Negret ("El Negro"), a member of the Acci√≥n Revolucionaria Democratica.
*   **Arrest and Interrogation:** AMFAUNA-14 was arrested by the DSE and interrogated by officers including Francisco ABAD and "Carlos" (possibly Samuel RODILES). She was questioned about her connections to VILLAR Negret and AMFAUNA-1.
*   **Cover Story:** AMFAUNA-14 initially denied knowing VILLAR Negret but eventually admitted to being a cutout between him and "Julio" (AMFAUNA-1).
*   **DSE Recruitment:** The DSE officers attempted to recruit AMFAUNA-14 to work with them, maintaining a link between them and KUBARK.
*   **Controlled Messages:** AMFAUNA-14 wrote three SW (secret writing) messages under DSE control.
*   **DSE Surveillance:** This revealed details about internal conflicts and security vulnerabilities within the CIA's Cuban operations, highlighting the pervasive reach and capabilities of Cuban counterintelligence.

## Intelligence on Castro Agents, Military Maneuvers, and Political Activities

The documents also provide insights into various other intelligence activities and findings:

*   **Castro Agents:** Reports indicate that Castro agents in the U.S. were attempting to determine the location of military training camps and identify individuals cooperating with the CIA.
*   **Military Maneuvers:** An agent reported observing approximately 200 tanks, some with twin cannons, participating in maneuvers near Havana in November 1963.
*   **Latin American Youth Congress:** The CIA monitored the activities of a Cuban-inspired Latin American Youth Congress in Santiago, Chile, identifying its organizer as Joaquin Mas Martinez, described as a "braintest" of the Castro followers.
*   **William Zebulon Foster:** The CIA tracked the movements and activities of William Zebulon Foster, a prominent American communist, during his travels in Europe in 1947, noting his meetings with other communist leaders.
*   **Jose Xavier Cortes Hernandez:** Intelligence reports indicate that a person named Jose Xavier Cortes Hernandez, claiming to be a priest, contacted the Cuban Ambassador to Mexico, Jose Antonio Portuondo Valdor, and discussed actions in Cuba, possibly related to establishing a schismatic church.

## Communication Intercepts

The documents include intercepted communications, mainly messages to agents relaying instructions and intelligence requests.

* **AMKHAN-2:** A series of communications with an agent, AMKHAN-2, focused on gathering intelligence related to military preparations on Cuba's north coast, potential landing of Chinese troops, and the identities of Cubana airline personnel. They also discussed the potential for a tap on AMKHAN-2's communication circuit to Key West.
* **PETGOS:** Another message focused on recruiting new members for the network, training protocols, and emphasizing caution when approaching potential recruits. The CIA wanted to verify the identity of a contact named Rene in Victoria, as well as his history and relationship with AMKHAN-2.
* **ARPANTY:** Intercepted transmissions with an agent providing details on individuals in charge of vigilance and intelligence, as well as information on safe houses and contacts. The communications also included warnings about potential leaks within the network and instructions to locate hidden caches.
* **AYSHATTER:** This communication mentioned an agent's request for extraction instructions and funds, as well as confirmation that previous intelligence reports had been sent through an embassy channel. The CIA decided against sending personal funds to the agent.

## Conclusion and Implications

These documents collectively paint a picture of the CIA's extensive efforts to gather intelligence, influence public opinion, and destabilize the Cuban government during a critical period in the Cold War. They underscore the agency's reliance on a network of assets, including media contacts, double agents, and informants, to achieve its objectives. The documents also reveal the challenges and risks associated with these operations, including the constant threat of exposure, the difficulty of maintaining secure communications, and the potential for manipulation by hostile intelligence services.

The implications of these findings are significant. They shed light on the complex and often morally ambiguous nature of covert operations, the relationship between intelligence agencies and the media, and the impact of the Cold War on Latin America. The documents also serve as a reminder of the importance of transparency and accountability in intelligence activities, particularly in a democratic society.

## JFK Files Explanation

Okay, imagine you've never heard of the JFK files or the Cold War. Here's a simplified version of the summary above:

**The CIA's Secret War Against Cuba**

Back in the 1960s, the United States and Cuba were enemies. Cuba had a communist government led by Fidel Castro, which the U.S. didn't like. So, the CIA (America's spy agency) launched a secret campaign to weaken Castro's government.

**Spies in the News**

One way the CIA did this was by working with journalists. They had a secret agreement with a reporter at *The Miami Herald* (we don't know his real name, so the CIA called him "AMCARBON-1"). The reporter agreed to publish stories that made Cuba look bad, and in return, the CIA gave him tips on other news stories. It was a way for the CIA to spread propaganda (information designed to influence public opinion) without anyone knowing they were involved.

**Secret Agents and Double Crosses**

The CIA also had other agents in Cuba, people who secretly worked for the U.S. government. One woman, "AMFAUNA-14," was caught by Cuban intelligence. She was interrogated (questioned) and then forced to become a double agent, pretending to work for the U.S. but actually feeding information to Cuba. This showed that the CIA's operations were risky and that the Cuban government was also good at spying.

**What Else Was Going On?**

The documents also show the CIA was trying to:

*   **Find spies:** They were looking for people who might be working for Castro in the U.S.
*   **Track military movements:** They wanted to know what kind of weapons Cuba had and where they were located.
*   **Influence young people:** They kept an eye on a youth conference in Chile that they believed was being run by Cuban communists.

**The Big Picture**

These documents give us a peek into the secret world of spies and covert operations. They show how the CIA was trying to undermine the Cuban government during the Cold War. They also raise questions about how far governments should go to achieve their goals, and how much the public should know about what their intelligence agencies are doing.
