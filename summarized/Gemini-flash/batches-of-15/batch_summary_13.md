# Unveiling CIA Operations: E. Howard Hunt, Yuri Nosenko, Herbert Itkin, and Schlumberger Corporation

This summary consolidates information from classified CIA documents to provide an overarching narrative of several key operations and individuals, including E. Howard Hunt's memoir review, the handling of Soviet defector Yuri Nosenko, the case of informant Herbert Itkin, and connections to the Schlumberger Corporation. The documents offer insights into the CIA's interactions with these figures and the measures taken to protect sensitive information and operational security.

## I. E. Howard Hunt and the Review of His Memoirs "Undercover"

### A. Scrutinizing Hunt's Manuscript (September 30, 1974)

*   **Context:** The CIA meticulously reviewed E. Howard Hunt's memoirs, "Undercover," to identify and redact classified information. The review took place on September 28, 1974, involving Hunt, his attorneys, and CIA representatives Ray Rocca and John D. Morrison, Jr.
*   **Process:** The CIA initially focused on three items deemed classified, with the understanding that further review would depend on Hunt's cooperation. Ultimately, all 32 items of concern were discussed.
*   **Classified Deletions:** Agreed-upon changes included:
    *   Disguising the identity of a fabricated newspaper used in a Mexican operation to avoid linking journalists to the Agency.
    *   Removing "Guatemalan" from a reference to an embassy entry in Mexico City, making it non-specific.
    *   Altering a paragraph on CIA-Uruguayan operations to remove references to electronic surveillance.
*   **Unclassified Modifications:** Hunt agreed to modify other items, including:
    *   Deleting the names of Henry Pleasants and Frank Holcomb, both retired undercover agents.
    *   Removing a direct reference to joint operations with the British in Hong Kong against China.
    *   Changing the wording regarding CIA alias documentation used by the Watergate burglars to avoid implying Agency involvement in the operation.
*   **Comfort Letter and Press Release:** Hunt provided a "comfort letter" assuring his publisher that the manuscript did not violate any agreements with the CIA or espionage laws. Despite Hunt's initial reluctance, he was persuaded to accept a CIA press release acknowledging the review to avoid the appearance of collusion or a whitewash of the Agency.

### B. Hunt's Alias and Travel Documents (November 2, 1973)

*   **Context**: In 1973, inquiries were made about whether the CIA had issued an alias passport to E. Howard Hunt in the name of Edward Hamilton, particularly following a newspaper article linking one of the Watergate burglars to that name.
*   **Tourist Card Discovery**: It was determined that Hunt possessed a tourist card in the alias of Edward Hamilton. This information came via the FBI from the U.S. Passport Office.
*   **Alias Birth Certificates**: A 1970 CIA exercise to recall outstanding alias birth certificates (mostly issued in connection with the Bay of Pigs operation) surfaced records showing that an alias birth certificate had been issued to Hunt under the name Edward Joseph Hamilton.
*   **Documentation**: A memorandum to Hunt dated June 29, 1970, and lists of true names with corresponding aliases confirmed the existence of the alias birth certificate, even though the memo had never been sent to Hunt due to his retirement.

## II. Yuri Nosenko: Defection, Confinement, and Continued Employment

### A. Handling a Soviet Defector (Various Dates: 1964-1974)

*   **Defection and Confinement:** Yuri Ivanovich Nosenko, a KGB officer, defected in 1964. After a period of relative freedom, he was involuntarily confined by the CIA from April 1964 to October 1967 at sites in Maryland and Virginia.
*   **Legal Justification:** The legal basis for Nosenko's confinement was discussed with the Deputy Attorney General on April 2, 1964. The Agency General Counsel advised that confinement was proper based on Nosenko's parole status.
*   **Agency and Government Awareness:** Letters from the DDCI, DCI, and others to various agencies, including the Department of Justice and the White House, indicate awareness of the Nosenko affair.
*   **Conditions of Confinement:** The Office of Security established the conditions of Nosenko's confinement.
*   **Assessment of Bona Fides:** By October 1968, the Director of Security forwarded reports from the Office of Security and the FBI concluding Nosenko was a bona fide defector. However, a CI Staff memorandum questioned Nosenko's authenticity.
*   **Continued Employment:** Despite doubts, Nosenko was given total freedom in April 1969 and employed by the Agency as a consultant, becoming a U.S. citizen in 1974.
*   **Controversial Actions**: During the confinement period, Nosenko was allowed a pleasure trip to Florida, during which Agency personnel procured prostitutes for him on at least two occasions, with apparent Headquarters approval.

### B. Treatment and Monitoring (May 12, 1964)

*   A memo dated May 12, 1964 detailed specific instructions regarding the treatment of Nosenko during his confinement. These instructions included regulating his diet, ensuring a comfortable temperature through air conditioning, and providing him with baths, clean underwear, uniforms, and linen changes. The memo also emphasized maintaining strict security procedures, including constant surveillance.

## III. Herbert Itkin: Informant, Legal Troubles, and CIA Connections

### A. Itkin's Role as an Informant (November 1, 1977)

*   **Haitian Exile Project:** Herbert Itkin, an unpaid witting informant, was used in 1963 to gather information on Haitian exiles seeking to overthrow President Duvalier. He acted as a legal advisor for a Haitian Government-In-Exile, investing $15,000 of his own funds.
*   **CIA Piggybacking:** CI Staff agent Bernard E. MONCURE leveraged Itkin's contacts to make his own operational contacts within the Haitian exile group.
*   **High-Level Interest:** Handwritten notes indicated high-level governmental interest in the activities of the Haitian exile group.
*   **Mafia Connections and Custody Battle:** Itkin, also a lawyer with Mafia and Teamsters connections, became a key witness in Mafia-related criminal indictments. He and his wife faced a custody battle over her children from a previous marriage, with Mrs. Itkin falsely claiming CIA involvement in taking the children to England.

### B. Investigation and Damage Control (January 31, 1969)

*   **Investigation into Roberts & Delson**: Confrontations with the New York FBI office lead to the need to investigate Thomas Roberts and Robert Delson due to their connection with Herbert Itkin.
*   **Thomas Roberts Involvement**: Thomas Roberts was a CIA staff agent since 1961. Questions arose regarding Robert's failure to disclose his relationship with Itkin and his financial arrangements with their law firm, plus Roberts alleged meeting with Itkin in Geneva, Switzerland March 1966 and was Roberts reporting this meeting.
*   **Robert Delson Involvement**: Concerns were raised about Robert Delson, including allegations of communist party membership and previous operational considerations.
*  **Damage Control**: CIA attempts to contain the situation and protect its operations, especially regarding Thomas Roberts and his involvement with Herbert Itkin.
*   **Protecting Sources**: CIA was reacting to Itkin's tactics to help his wife gain custody over her children. The FBI was more interested in protecting Itkin’s reputation as a witness. The CIA did pass information elicited by Moncure from Itkin to the Attorney General in 1963 on a Department of Labor official’s alleged criminal involvement with the Mafia.

### C. Australian Inquiry (November 16, 1973)

*   **Reliability Questioned:** An Australian Justice, A. R. Moffitt, sought information on Itkin's reliability, describing him as a former CIA and FBI employee. Moffitt was inquiring into organized crime in New South Wales and considering Itkin's testimony in an English court case.
*   **OGC Response:** The CIA's Office of General Counsel (OGC) provided copies of affidavits related to Itkin's CIA affiliation, clarifying that Itkin furnished information to the CIA but was not sent to England to collect information for the Agency.

## IV. Schlumberger Corporation: Connections and Security Concerns

### A. Allegations and CIA Ties (December 12, 1967)

*   **Garrison's Claims:** Jim Garrison claimed that the burglary of the Houma munitions bunker was "CIA-inspired" and issued arrest warrants for Gordon Novel and Sergio Arcacha Smith.
*   **CIA Denial:** The CIA denied any connection to the alleged burglary or the bunker itself.
*   **Contact Interest:** Pierre Schlumberger, president of the Schlumberger Corporation, was of contact interest in 1950 for routine exploitation as a foreign intelligence source.
*   **Daystrom Acquisition:** When Schlumberger acquired Daystrom, Inc., the CIA had a classified contract with Daystrom for limpet mines. The merger prompted a decision to avoid classified contracts with foreign firms.

### B. Security Vetting and Historical Contacts

*   **Latin American Presence**: In 1947, the Schlumberger Company was the subject of a name check due to numerous corporations in Latin America dominated by French nationals.
*   **Oil Well Shooting Service**: Schlumberger had a patented "oil well shooting" service subscribed to by various oil companies. Henri Georges Doll, a French national, controlled the Schlumberger Well Surveying Corporation in Houston.
*   **Geophysical Expertise**: In 1951, the Agency sought to contact Professor Edouard Poldini, formerly employed by Schlumberger in Paris, for operational use in gathering information about oil fields in Hungary.
*   **Soviet Correspondence**: In 1953, an FBI source indicated that Maurice Henri Martin, an engineer at Schlumberger in Paris, received a letter from Moscow requesting geophysical information, raising concerns about potential Soviet contact.
*   **Personnel Concerns**: Research into the directors and officers of Schlumberger, Ltd. revealed various security concerns:
    *   Dillon Anderson, a trustee of Electro-Mechanical Research, had past connections with the National Security Council.
    *   Charles C. Parlin, a director of Schlumberger, was associated with individuals linked to Soviet agents and had traveled to Russia.
    *   Clark Drouillard Goodman, Vice-President of Schlumberger, was security disapproved due to his support of a colleague indicted as a Communist conspirator.

### C. French Intelligence and Soviet Links

*   **Schneider and Company Connection**: Schlumberger and another subsidiary, Machines Bull, were linked to Schneider and Company, represented by Francois Saar-Demichel, a suspected Soviet agent.

## Concluding Summary

These documents paint a picture of the CIA's multifaceted operations during the Cold War and beyond. The E. Howard Hunt documents illustrate the agency's concern with controlling information within its own ranks and the potential fallout from public disclosures. The Nosenko case highlights the complexities of handling defectors, including the ethical dilemmas and the ongoing debate over their true allegiances. The Itkin case reveals the use of informants, the risks associated with their connections, and the agency's efforts to manage potential damage to its reputation and operations. Finally, the Schlumberger documents underscore the pervasive security concerns surrounding international corporations and the constant vigilance required to protect U.S. interests. These cases collectively highlight the challenges of maintaining secrecy, managing human assets, and navigating the complex landscape of intelligence gathering.

## Explanation for a Reader Unfamiliar with JFK Files

Okay, imagine the CIA is like a giant puzzle, and these documents are just a few pieces of that puzzle. What they show is a glimpse into how the CIA worked behind the scenes during the Cold War and the years that followed. The key here is understanding that the CIA was trying to gather information, protect secrets, and influence events, all while operating in a very secretive way.

**What were they doing?**

*   **Scrutinizing a Watergate Figure:** The documents show the CIA carefully reviewing a memoir by E. Howard Hunt, who was involved in the Watergate scandal. This was because the CIA wanted to make sure Hunt didn't reveal any secret operations or compromise national security in his book.
*   **Managing a Defector:** The documents also shed light on how the CIA handled a Soviet defector, Yuri Nosenko. This is about the challenges of figuring out if someone is truly on your side when they come over from the enemy and the steps they took to deal with this challenge. This involved confining him for a period of time to thoroughly vet him and determine if he was a legit defector or a double agent.
*   **Dealing with an Informant:** The files also discuss an informant named Herbert Itkin. This reveals how the CIA uses everyday people to gather information. In this case, Itkin's personal life created many complications that the CIA had to deal with.
*   **Investigating a Corporation:** Finally, the documents show the CIA looking into the Schlumberger Corporation. This illustrates how the CIA scrutinized companies with international reach for potential security risks.

**Why does this matter?**

These documents are a small window into the world of intelligence operations. They show that the CIA wasn't just about spies and gadgets; it was also about managing relationships, controlling information, and making difficult decisions in a world filled with uncertainty and threats. Understanding these types of operations helps us get a better picture of what intelligence agencies do, why they do it, and the impact their actions have on the world.
