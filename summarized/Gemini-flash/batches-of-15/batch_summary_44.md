# CIA's Covert Operations Against Castro: A Summary of Key Documents (1961-1966)

This summary synthesizes classified CIA documents from 1961 to 1966, detailing the agency's efforts to destabilize and overthrow Fidel Castro's regime in Cuba. The documents reveal a complex web of covert operations, including propaganda campaigns, support for Cuban exile groups, infiltration attempts, and internal purges.

## Frustration with the Cuban Revolutionary Council (CRC) and Dr. Miro Cardona (October 1961)

*   **Context:** In October 1961, a meeting took place between a CIA representative and Dr. Miro Cardona, the president of the Cuban Revolutionary Council (CRC), a U.S.-backed umbrella organization for Cuban exiles.

*   **Key Issues:**
    *   Dr. Miro expressed deep dissatisfaction with the CIA's handling of anti-Castro efforts, stating that the agency was undermining the CRC by independently supporting various exile groups.
    *   He complained that the CRC was being sidelined and rendered ineffective due to the CIA's direct dealings with other organizations, which didn't want to work with the Council.
    *   He felt powerless in coordinating resistance efforts because he lacked control over resources and planning. Miro declared he had no arms to give.
    *   Dr. Miro requested funding for clandestine groups, arms for the Escambray resistance, and support for propaganda efforts, such as "Operation Griseta," but felt his requests were being ignored.
    *   Dr. Miro expressed concern about the lack of a unified plan and the potential for increased violence and disorder in Cuba due to uncoordinated actions.
    *   He also referenced a White House meeting where it was agreed that the CRC would be the primary coordinating body, a directive he believed was not being followed.

*   **Significance:** These documents highlight the tensions and inefficiencies within the U.S. strategy to overthrow Castro, as well as Miro Cardona's frustration. They reveal a lack of coordination and the CIA's apparent preference for managing anti-Castro operations through multiple channels, rather than relying solely on the CRC.

## Clandestine Operations and Proposed Action Plan (October 1961)

*   **Context:** In early October 1961, Dr. Miro presented a plan for clandestine action in Cuba to a CIA representative.

*   **Key Elements:**
    *   Dr. Miro handed over a plan, prepared by his military collaborators, including Colonel Manuel VARELA Castro, Captain Enrique DESPAIGNE, and Colonel (inu) MONTEAGUDO, for clandestine action.
    *   The plan involved commando raids by 300 men, some in Miami, some in Cuba, to bolster morale and sabotage the Cuban economy, requiring U.S. support in weapons, equipment, and funding.
    *   Dr. Miro reiterated the importance of providing arms to anti-Castro insurgents in the Escambray region, led by Osvaldo RAMIREZ.
    *   Dr. Miro proposed that the Revolutionary Council establish a government on Cuban soil, seek recognition from friendly countries, and request immediate military assistance from the U.S.
    *   The operation would start with a commando raid to seize Cuban territory near Guantanamo, followed by the Council's members proclaiming a provisional government.

*   **Significance:** Miro Cardonaâ€™s desperation shows the need to take military action before the Castro Regime gets stronger and continues to deteriorate the economy. The United States is blamed for the propaganda of anti-Castro. The enemy would denounce the U.S. for the intervention of Cuba.

## Internal Purges in Cuba (March 1966)

*   **Context:** By March 1966, the documents shifted focus to internal purges within the Cuban government and Communist Party, as reported by Reuters.

*   **Key Findings:**
    *   A widespread purge was underway, targeting military officers, high officials, and Communist Party leaders.
    *   Fidel Castro revealed the arrest of labor union leaders for embezzlement and announced investigations into the "moral and political practices" of officials.
    *   Major Efigenio Ameijeiras, a high-ranking military official, was dismissed and faced trial, accused of "indulging 'la dolce vita.'"
    *   The trial of Rolando Cubela and Ramon Guin, accused of plotting to overthrow Castro with the support of Cuban exiles, sparked student unrest, including anti-government graffiti.
    *   The underlying causes for the purges included the failure of the government to address domestic and international problems, severe shortages of basic goods, and a declining sugar crop.
    *   Castro permitted Cuban exiles to seek refuge in the U.S.

*   **CIA Response:**
    *   The CIA planned to exploit these developments through psychological operations (PSYOP), emphasizing Castro's desperation and comparing him to other failed leaders.
    *   The CIA sought to establish contact with Cuban foreign ministry and trade personnel abroad, encouraging them to cooperate with the U.S.

## Covert Actions and Key Individuals:

*   **Rolando Cubela Secades (AMLASH/1):** A medical doctor and Cuban Army officer, involved in a covert communications system with the CIA. He was later arrested and tried for plotting against Castro.
*   **Manuel (Pineiro) Lozada:** An individual within the Cuban government who expressed interest in traveling to Italy and meeting with Delorry.
*   **Delorry:** A person who traveled to Italy in March 1966, after being in Cuba.
*   **Antonio Carrillo:** A contact of AMWEST/1, who met with him in Geneva in March 1966. Carrillo is connected with AMWHIP-2.
*   **Hortensia Orizondo Meneses (AMFAUNA/3):** Identified as an ACSI source, allegedly involved in funding infiltration attempts into Cuba.

## Inter-Agency Conflicts and Infiltration Attempts

*   **Context:** An investigation into the sponsorship of an infiltration attempt led by AMTRUNK-9 revealed a conflict between the CIA (KUBARK) and Army Counterintelligence (ACSI).
*   **Key Issues:**
    *   Substantial evidence suggested ACSI involvement, including statements from AMTRUNK-9's wife, AMICE-14, and a note from AMFAUNA-3.
    *   ACSI denied official participation but did not rule out insubordination or misrepresentation.
    *   Evidence indicated that an agent handler, "Torres," was connected to ACSI.
    *   "Torres" automobile had license plates blocked for covert use by ODYOKE.
*   **Significance:** It is not immediately clear how each individual or group may have influenced each other.

## Key Themes and Implications

*   **Coordination Challenges:** The documents consistently highlight the difficulties in coordinating anti-Castro efforts due to conflicting agendas, lack of trust, and competing interests among various U.S. agencies and exile groups.
*   **Importance of Propaganda:** The CIA recognized the importance of propaganda in undermining Castro's regime and sought to exploit internal divisions and economic hardships through targeted messaging.
*   **Exploitation of Internal Dissension:** The CIA actively monitored and sought to exploit internal purges and dissent within the Cuban government and Communist Party.
*   **Human Intelligence Gathering:** The documents demonstrate the CIA's reliance on human intelligence sources, including Cuban exiles and defectors, to gather information and conduct covert operations.
*   **Ethical Considerations:** The documents raise ethical questions about the CIA's involvement in plots to overthrow foreign governments and its use of covert operations that could endanger the lives of individuals involved.

## Conclusion

These documents provide a glimpse into the complex and multifaceted efforts by the CIA to destabilize and overthrow Fidel Castro's regime in Cuba between 1961 and 1966. They reveal a landscape of covert operations, internal conflicts, and shifting strategies, driven by the overarching goal of containing communism in the Western Hemisphere. The challenges in coordinating anti-Castro efforts, the importance of propaganda, and the exploitation of internal dissension emerge as key themes. The documents also raise ethical considerations about the scope and methods of U.S. intervention in Cuban affairs during this period.

## Simplified Explanation for Readers Unfamiliar with JFK Files

Okay, imagine these documents as puzzle pieces from a very secret game the CIA was playing with Fidel Castro's Cuba back in the early 1960s. The U.S. government was *really* worried about Cuba being communist, especially because it was so close to America.

**What was the game?** Basically, the CIA wanted to get rid of Castro. They tried lots of things, like:

*   **Propaganda:** Spreading rumors and negative information about Castro to make Cubans unhappy with him.
*   **Supporting Cuban Exiles:** Helping groups of Cubans who had fled Cuba because they didn't like Castro's government. The idea was these exiles could start a rebellion.
*   **Infiltration:** Sending secret agents into Cuba to gather information and maybe even cause trouble for Castro.

**Who are some of the key players?**

*   **Fidel Castro:** The leader of Cuba, who the U.S. was trying to get rid of.
*   **Dr. Miro Cardona:** The leader of a group of Cuban exiles that the U.S. was supporting. He was supposed to be a key guy in uniting the exiles, but the documents show he was frustrated because the CIA often went around him and worked with other groups directly.
*   **Various Codenames (AMLASH, AMTRUNK, etc.):** The CIA used codenames to protect the identities of their agents and sources. So, you'll see these names popping up, but we don't always know exactly who they are.

**What are some of the big problems the documents reveal?**

*   **Lack of Coordination:** The different parts of the U.S. government (like the CIA and the Army) weren't always working together very well. They had different ideas about how to get rid of Castro, and sometimes they even worked against each other.
*   **Mistrust:** The Cuban exiles didn't always trust each other, or the U.S. government. This made it hard to form a united front against Castro.
*   **Things Falling Apart Inside Cuba:** By the mid-1960s, there were signs that things were getting tough in Cuba. There were food shortages, and Castro was starting to crack down on people he thought were disloyal. The CIA saw this as an opportunity to stir up more trouble.

**So, what's the overall picture?**

These documents show a messy, complicated, and ultimately unsuccessful effort by the U.S. to overthrow Castro. It wasn't a clean, straightforward operation; it was full of infighting, mistrust, and things going wrong. It also raises questions about whether it was right for the U.S. to try to interfere in Cuba's government in the first place.

Hopefully, this explanation gives you a better sense of what these JFK file documents are about, even if you don't know all the details. They're basically pieces of a historical puzzle that help us understand a tense and controversial period in U.S.-Cuban relations.
