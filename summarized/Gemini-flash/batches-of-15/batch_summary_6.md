# CIA Activities in Cuba, December 1963: Exfiltration, Agent Networks, and Intelligence Gathering

This summary synthesizes several classified CIA documents from December 1963, shedding light on the agency's multifaceted operations in Cuba. These operations included the exfiltration of compromised agents, the maintenance and potential expansion of agent networks, and the collection of intelligence on Cuban military capabilities and Soviet presence. The documents reveal a sense of urgency and a proactive approach to managing risks and exploiting opportunities within the complex landscape of Cold War espionage.

## The AMFAUMA Network and Exfiltration Challenges

*   **AMFAUMA-25's Precarious Situation:** The documents highlight the urgent need to exfiltrate AMFAUMA-25, a Cuban asset employed in the insurance section of the Cuban Finance Ministry. AMFAUMA-25's travel was restricted due to Cuba's state-controlled economy and currency shortages. The only potential avenue for legal departure involved securing an invitation to London to discuss Cuban insurance problems with Minet Co. London.

*   **Compromised Channels:** The primary concern driving the urgency was the potential arrest of AMCUTLER-2, whose capture would lead to the exposure of numerous other agents (AMFAUNA's 4, 10, 15, 18, 19, 25, 26, 27, 29, 30, 31, 32, 36, 37, and 38). AMCUTLER-2 had gone into hiding, severing the secure communication link between WAVE and AMFAUMA-25. The communication link was: WAVE to ANCUTLER-2 to AMFAUMA-27 to AMFAUMA-25.

*   **Proposed Solution: London Exfiltration:** To address the lack of direct contact and the threat of exposure, the CIA proposed arranging a legal trip for AMFAUMA-25 to London, ostensibly to discuss Cuban insurance matters with Minet Co. This approach required enlisting the "SMOTH" (likely a reference to a specific operational group or individual within the CIA) to facilitate the travel. If AMFAUMA-25 made it to London, he would be debriefed for information of Cuban Finance Ministry, his ties to Che Guevara, and his general knowledge of Cuba's inner workings.

*   **AMFAUMA-14 Success & Potential Asset Redeployment:** The successful exfiltration of AMFAUMA-14 mitigated the immediate threat to AMFAUNA-35 and AMFAUNA-39, whose security was directly threatened by AMFAUMA-14's potential exposure. Bernardo (Alvarez) and Eduardo Vega were eliminated as threats as initial debriefings showed they didn't know about the DSE. If AMFAUMA-25 was debriefed, and AMCUTLER-2 was extracted successfully before AMFAUMA-25's travel time expired, he could be kept in Cuba as a controlled asset providing valuable information due to his access.

## Expanding Agent Networks and Recruiting Efforts

*   **Recruitment in Holguin:** The CIA was actively recruiting action personnel in hidden places, particularly in the Holguin province. The documents mention several potential recruits recommended by "Ruben" and "Doimeadios," including Jose Gonzalez Canto, Roberto Zayas, Medardo Silva Marrero, Roberto Licon, and Leonardo Pupo Romero.

*   **Infiltration and Sabotage:** Potential recruits were assessed for their skills in handling weapons and explosives. The documents allude to sabotage objectives and the establishment of caches for explosive materials. The intent was to create action cells capable of conducting sabotage operations within Cuba. One such sabotage objective was the Tank Park.

*   **Intelligence Gathering in Matanzas:** The CIA was actively seeking information on the Tank Park and the people living at Punto Tomate. This information was to be used to plan potential sabotage operations.

## Intelligence Collection on Cuban Military and Soviet Activity

*   **Soviet Personnel and Cargo Movements:** The documents detail observations of Soviet personnel and cargo movements between Batabano and Isla de Pinos. Informants reported the arrival of 24 men appearing to be Soviets in Batabano, who then boarded a ferry to Isla de Pinos. Additionally, olive-green trucks were observed transporting boxes from Isla de Pinos to Batabano.

*   **Torrens Base Activity:** There are reports of significant truck traffic entering the Torrens base, a former reformatory on the Wajay Highway southwest of Havana. Witnesses observed large trailer trucks carrying tube-like objects, possibly related to surface-to-air missiles. This corroborates intelligence suggesting that the Torrens surface-to-air missile assembly area was active during this period.

*   **Naval Vessel Intelligence:** AMTURVY-1 was tasked with gathering information on Cuban naval vessels, specifically the Komar-class boats and P-6 class boats. The agent was asked to determine if these boats carried live rockets and torpedoes, the type of fuel used, and any modifications made to enhance their power. Additionally, AMTURVY-1 was instructed to investigate whether certain Cuban fishing boats (San Ignacio, Maria Elena, and Los Angeles) were involved in transporting arms to Latin America and if they had radio communications capabilities.

*   **Coastal Surveillance:** There was increased militia surveillance along the northern coast of Matanzas province, particularly near Rio Palma, with multiple arrests in the area.

## Key Personnel and Operational Codes

*   **AMFAUMA-25:** Cuban asset in the insurance section of the Cuban Finance Ministry.
*   **AMCUTLER-2:** Key agent whose arrest would compromise a large network.
*   **"SMOTH":** Likely a reference to a specific operational group or individual within the CIA involved in facilitating sensitive operations.
*   **Peter Minet:** Connected to Minet Co. London. He was to be expedited to London to discuss AMFAUMA-25's travel to Britain with the SMOTH
*   **Enrique Vicente Socorras:** Used as a channel to communicate messages.
*   **"Ruben" and "Doimeadios":** Individuals recommending potential recruits in Holguin.

## Conclusion

The CIA documents from December 1963 paint a picture of a dynamic and high-stakes intelligence operation in Cuba. The agency was grappling with compromised networks, actively recruiting new agents, and diligently collecting intelligence on Cuban military capabilities and Soviet activities. The urgency in these documents underscores the intense pressures of the Cold War, where the constant threat of exposure and the need for timely, accurate information were paramount. The proactive measures proposed, such as the London exfiltration plan for AMFAUMA-25 and the expansion of agent networks in Holguin, reflect a determined effort to maintain a strategic advantage in the face of evolving challenges. The focus on intelligence gathering, particularly regarding Soviet involvement and Cuban military assets, highlights the strategic importance of Cuba as a key battleground in the global struggle against communism. The documents offer a glimpse into the complex interplay of espionage, risk management, and strategic planning that defined CIA operations during this critical period.

## JFK Files Novice Explanation
Okay, so let's break down what all this means in a way that's easier to understand for someone who's never looked at declassified JFK files before.

**Imagine a Spy Movie**

Think of this like a script for a spy movie set in Cuba during the Cold War (1963). The CIA (the good guys, from the US perspective) is trying to gather information and influence events in Cuba, which was then led by Fidel Castro and aligned with the Soviet Union (the bad guys, from the US perspective).

**What's Happening?**

Essentially, the CIA is juggling three main things:

1.  **Getting Agents Out (Exfiltration):** Some of the CIA's Cuban spies are in danger of being caught. This is especially true for a guy called **AMFAUMA-25**. The agency needs to find a way to get him out of Cuba safely before he's arrested. Their plan involves a fake business trip to London to discuss insurance matters.

2.  **Building Spy Networks (Recruitment):** The CIA is always looking for new people to work for them inside Cuba. They have people like **Ruben and Doimeadios** who are recommending potential recruits in a specific area (Holguin province). They're looking for people who are good with weapons and explosives to potentially carry out sabotage.

3.  **Gathering Intel (Intelligence):** The CIA wants to know what the Cubans are up to, especially anything involving the Soviet Union. They're tracking troop movements, cargo shipments, and military equipment. They're especially interested in a military base called **Torrens** and naval vessels.

**Key Terms and People**

*   **CIA:** Central Intelligence Agency, the US spy agency.
*   **Cuba:** Island nation led by Fidel Castro, allied with the Soviet Union.
*   **Cold War:** The tense standoff between the US and the Soviet Union.
*   **Agents:** Cubans who are secretly working for the CIA. They are given code names for security (like **AMFAUMA-25**).
*   **Exfiltration:** Secretly getting someone out of a country.
*   **Intel (Intelligence):** Information about the enemy.
*   **Moscow:** In these documents, its likely to represent The Soviet Union as a whole, which supported Cuba at the time.
*   **"AM...":** Code names for assets operating within Cuba for the CIA.
*   **WAVE:** The CIA Station handling the operation.
*   **DIR:** The CIA director
*   **DSE:** Unknown what it stands for in this document.
*   **RYBAT TYPIC:** A code to identify the type of message being sent.
*    **SMOTH:** An unidentified entity that can help with secret operations.

**Why Does This Matter?**

These documents show the CIA's intense focus on Cuba during the Cold War. The agency was willing to take significant risks to gather information, protect its agents, and potentially disrupt Cuban operations. This was all part of a larger effort to contain the spread of communism and counter Soviet influence around the world. The Kennedy assassination took place in November of 1963, and these documents were all created in December of 1963. This means the assassination took place between the operations. This would have been a time of high alert, and it would have amplified the CIA's actions in Cuba.
