# CIA Operations: Awards, Technology, and Personnel Management (1959-1987)

This summary compiles several CIA documents from 1959 to 1987, revealing insights into agency award processes, technological development, and the management of personnel, including security considerations, overseas assignments, and cover operations.

## Honor Awards and Recognition

*   **Certificate of Merit Disapproval (2 March 1959):** An Honor Awards Board considered a recommendation for an award to an Acting D.p. Chtos/c/00 assigned to Security. The recommendation was for "Heroic Action" or "Meritorious Achievement or Service" between 1 July and 15 August 1953.
    *   The Board concluded that the service, while valuable, was not outstanding enough to warrant an honor award. This highlights the rigorous standards for CIA commendations.

## Technological Development: The Identi-Kit

*   **Identi-Kit Development and Security (21 March 1960):** A memorandum from the Chief, TSD/Security, discusses the CIA's involvement in the development of the Identi-Kit.
    *   The Agency invested $82,531 into the Identi-Kit, exceeding the $37,000 mentioned in a "Science and Mechanics" magazine article.
    *   Hugh C. MCDONALD, a cleared TSD consultant, was instrumental in the project. The Agency sponsored his visits to Washington and Honolulu.
    *   The Townsend Corporation, working with MCDONALD, built the kits and was tasked with informing the Agency about sales to foreign powers.
    *   Courtney OWENS, Sales Manager of Townsend Engineering Corporation, was a TSD/EB cleared source who understood the Agency's interest.
    *   Three individuals from TSD attended a school opened by Townsend for Identi-kit users.
    *   The memo suggests an interview with MCDONALD to determine why U.S. Intelligence involvement was mentioned in the magazine article and to re-brief him if necessary.
    *   Robert SWENDIMAN was to be consulted to determine if other Agency components had used MCDONALD.

## Covert Operations and Personnel: Stratton and JMATE

*   **Operational Use of Michael Weimer Stratton (1 Feb. 1961):** A memo for the record discusses the operational use of Michael Weimer STRATTON within the U.S. by WH/4/Propaganda.
    *   Concerns were raised about the implications of a CIA operation within the United States and the possibility of the FBI becoming aware of STRATTON's activities through his association with Court WOOK.
    *   Mr. MCCORD of SRS believed it was unnecessary to inform the FBI at that time but wanted to review the case in a month. David Atlee PHILLIPS (#40695) was supervising the operation.

*   **Emilio Americo Rodriguez: Contract Agent (August 31, 1961):** A Personal History Statement reveals details about Emilio Americo RODRIGUEZ.
    *   RODRIGUEZ was applying for a position as a contract agent, seeking an annual salary of $9,600.00.
    *   He indicated willingness to travel and accept assignments in the U.S. and outside the continental U.S., provided there were adequate pay and living conditions for his family.
    *   He was born in Havana, Cuba, on January 27, 1928, and became a naturalized U.S. citizen on December 15, 1949.
    *   He used the alias EUGENIO GONZALEZ from April 1960 in Havana and Miami.
    *   He had extensive knowledge of Cuba, particularly Havana, and its political, economic, and social structure.
    *   His father, Arneste Napoleon RODRIGUEZ, was an intelligence agent for the U.S. Embassy in Havana during World War I, World War II, and the Castro Revolution.
    *   He was fluent in Spanish, Portuguese, French, and Italian.
    *   RODRIGUEZ worked for Century Electric Company in Havana from 1954 to 1960 and left due to the conditions in Cuba and his assignment as a principal agent for the CIA.

*   **Investigation related to Project JMATE (15 Jan 1965):** A memo details a security investigation into an individual, likely related to the aforementioned Emilio Americo Rodriguez.
    *   The investigation was initiated at the request of the Chief, CI/OA, concerning the subject's potential use as a PA-PROP Asset in Miami by WH/SA/IOS under Project JMATE.
    *   The case was closed pending further notification, suggesting either approval or lack of findings that would impede the approval.

## Personnel Management and Overseas Assignments: The Case of Joseph S. Piccolo

*   **Reassignment Processing of Joseph Piccolo (Various Dates):** Several documents concern the reassignment and travel briefings of Joseph S. PICCOLO.
    *   A request from 27 Sept 1968, requests Piccolo's return from Managua, Nicaragua, for assignment in JMCOBRA. He was medically approved for overseas assignment in December 1967.
    *   On 20 December 1967, a request was made for PICCOLO's lateral transfer from Managua, Nicaragua, to Mexico City, with the cover of "State Integree".
    *   PICCOLO was to be in Headquarters around 23 January 1968.
    *   In 1987, PICCOLO was reassigned to Mexico City with "State" cover. A travel briefing was conducted on 9/15/87.

## Security and Cover Operations: The Tarasoff Family

*   **Anna Tarasoff's Father's Visit to the Russian Embassy (13 October 1960):** A memorandum discusses the security implications of Anna TARASOFF's father's potential visit to the Russian Embassy to obtain a visa.
    *   A meeting was convened to address the issue, involving representatives from various CIA offices.
    *   TARASOFF's father, ANTHONY ADAMOVIEZ, wanted to visit his siblings in Russia and intended to inquire at the Russian Embassy in Washington.
    *   It was decided that ADAMOVIEZ should not be briefed about his daughter's CIA employment. Instead, a U.S. Army Translation Unit cover would be provided for Anna TARASOFF, retroactive to her entry on duty.
    *   The group agreed that because ADAMOVIEZ was unaware of his daughter's employment with the CIA, he would not be specially briefed on how to respond if questioned about it.
    *   Expedited credit checks on TARASOFF and her husband, BORIS D. TARASOFF, revealed no record of their Agency employment.
    *   BORIS TARASOFF was working in Mexico under "light state cover" but was backstopped as a contract employee of the Department of State, Escort Branch, Division of Language Services.
    *   It was learned that ADAMOVIEZ had visited the Embassy and listed his daughter by her maiden name, easing concerns.

*   **Reinvestigation of Boris Tarasoff (9 Sept 1966):** A reinvestigation of BORIS DIMITRI TARASOFF was pended to 1 Sept 1968, as an investigation had occurred within the last five years and he was currently assigned overseas.

*   **Boris Tarasoff as Interpreter (13 February 1962):** BORIS TARASOFF was used as an interpreter for a Soviet Delegation. The use was approved by Mr. Kuhn. He was working under State Department cover as a contractor for the language school.

*   **Boris Tarasoff TDY to Mexico City (5 July 1960):** Boris Tarasoff was assigned on a temporary duty (TDY) to Mexico City for 90 days. The assignment served as a replacement for a Station Employee on home leave. He was working under light state cover.

## Conclusion

These documents collectively offer a glimpse into the CIA's operational activities, personnel management, and security protocols during the Cold War era and beyond. They illustrate the meticulous nature of the Agency's operations, from awarding meritorious service to developing and securing sensitive technologies like the Identi-Kit. The documents underscore the complexity of managing personnel, including maintaining cover, addressing potential security risks, and facilitating overseas assignments. The cases of Emilio Americo RODRIGUEZ, Joseph S. PICCOLO, and the TARASOFF family highlight the diverse roles individuals played within the Agency and the lengths to which the CIA went to protect its operations and personnel. The meticulous nature of the records indicates the importance placed on documentation and internal communication within the CIA.

## Explanation for Readers Unfamiliar with JFK Files

Okay, imagine you're piecing together a story from scattered fragments of a secret organization's internal files. That's what these documents are. Think of them as pieces of a puzzle about the CIA during the Cold War and beyond.

Here's the overall picture:

*   **The CIA was involved in more than just spying:** These documents show the agency also had a hand in developing technologies (like the Identi-Kit used for creating facial composites), recognizing employees for good work, and, most importantly, managing its people and keeping secrets.
*   **Keeping secrets was REALLY important:** A big theme is "cover." This means creating fake identities and stories to hide what CIA employees were really doing. For example, some employees pretended to work for the State Department or even the Army, when really, they were gathering intelligence.
*   **People's lives got complicated:** Because of the need for secrecy, even family members sometimes didn't know the truth about what their loved ones did for the CIA. This created tricky situations. One document describes how the CIA had to handle the fact that an agent's father was planning a trip to the Soviet embassy!
*   **Overseas assignments were common:** The CIA had people stationed all over the world, like in Mexico City, Managua (Nicaragua), and elsewhere. These assignments often involved risks and required careful planning.
*   **The Cold War context:** These documents give you a sense of the tensions and concerns of the Cold War era. The CIA was constantly worried about being discovered, about its agents being compromised, and about the Soviet Union.

Think of these documents as snapshots of real people in real situations, navigating the dangerous and secretive world of intelligence during a tense period in history. They offer a glimpse into the inner workings of an organization that played a significant role in shaping global events. They also illustrate how those efforts affected regular people.
