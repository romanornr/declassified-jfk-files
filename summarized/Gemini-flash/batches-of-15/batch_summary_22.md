## Classified CIA Documents: A Synthesis of Operations and Suspects

This summary synthesizes several declassified CIA documents, shedding light on various agency operations, security investigations, and suspect assessments conducted primarily during the Cold War era. The documents cover a range of topics, from potential agent recruitment and operational planning against Cuba to security concerns surrounding individuals with possible connections to hostile intelligence services.

### Iriving Amron: A Defector with a Dubious Past (October 22, 1964)

The document focuses on Irving Amron, an individual who responded to a CIA advertisement (AEEXPLORE) seeking a Russian language linguist. An interview was conducted, revealing a complex and potentially problematic background:

- **Family History:** Amron's family had a history of involvement with the Soviet Union, with his father being a firm believer in Soviet Communism and having moved the family to Birobidzhan in 1931 before returning to the USA in 1933 and again the family returned to the USSR later in 1933.
- **Soviet Citizenship:** Amron claimed he acquired Soviet citizenship "by default" through his mother's application, a claim deemed illogical by the interviewer.
- **Military Service:** Despite being an American citizen, Amron served in the Soviet military during World War II and obtained an officer status, which was considered highly unusual.
- **Defection:** Subject expressed his wish to defect, and his father arrived in Moscow in 1957 to “establish at first hand” his son’s wish to defect to the USA.
- **Inconsistencies and Suspicions:** The interviewer noted numerous inconsistencies in Amron's story, his tendency to prevaricate, and his admission that he had led almost a "charming existence" in the USSR and that neither life in the USSR nor the Soviet authorities ristreated him. This led the interviewer to believe that Amron may have been a recruited agent of the KGB and that he left the USSR with the KGB's intercession.
- **Conclusion:** Due to the inconsistencies, perceived lack of frankness, and suspicious elements in his background, Amron was not recommended for either ARSCREEN or AEEXPLORE.
