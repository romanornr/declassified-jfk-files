# The CIA's Covert Operations Against Cuba: A Synthesis of Declassified Documents

This summary synthesizes declassified CIA documents to provide a comprehensive overview of the agency's covert operations against Cuba, particularly focusing on the activities of Cuban exile groups like AMSPELL and their interactions with the CIA during the early to mid-1960s. It highlights the complex relationships, internal conflicts, and the overall objectives of these clandestine efforts.

## Establishing Context: Anti-Castro Activities and CIA Involvement

The documents reveal the CIA's extensive involvement with various Cuban exile groups aiming to destabilize and ultimately overthrow Fidel Castro's regime. These groups, often funded and supported by the CIA, engaged in propaganda, intelligence gathering, and paramilitary activities. The documents also show how the CIA used propaganda and misinformation to rally support for anti-Castro efforts and undermine the Cuban government.

## AMSPELL: Structure, Funding, and Objectives

*   **Overview**: AMSPELL, a prominent Cuban exile student group, was a key asset for the CIA's JMWAVE station, operating primarily in propaganda and intelligence gathering.
*   **Funding**: The CIA provided substantial financial support to AMSPELL, with monthly expenditures detailed in the documents. For example, a September 1962 report shows total AMSPELL support at $50,960.40. These funds covered salaries, operational expenses, and overhead.
*   **Objectives**: AMSPELL aimed to influence public opinion, both in Cuba and internationally, against the Castro regime and to create pressure for action from the U.S. government. This was achieved through various means, including:
    *   Publishing newsletters, such as "The Cuban Report," distributed to U.S. officials and congressmen.
    *   Exploiting the impact of events like the August 24th attack on Havana in PBPRIME news media.
    *   Collecting and transmitting intelligence reports and photographs on the Soviet buildup in Cuba.

## Key Individuals and Their Roles

*   **IDEN A & IDEN B**: Collin E. Ostrander, USIA Representative, San Juan, and Waldemar F. Lee, Netherlands Consul, San Juan, respectively. They are identified as being involved in communications channels related to Cuban exiles.
*   **AMHINT-2**: A principal agent of the AMSPELL operation, serving as a key contact point between the organization and the CIA.
*   **AMHINT-53**: Exfiltrated from PBRUMEN (Cuba) in September 1962, provided an optimistic operational report on AMSPELL organization, and became a central figure in negotiations with JMWAVE.
*   **Carlos "TRIPA" Artecona**: Sought assistance in obtaining miniature cameras to transmit to PBRUMEN through a channel established with IDEN B.
*   **Jose Artecona**: Brother of Carlos "TRIPA" Artecona, in contact with IDEN A.
*   **Carlos Prio Socarras**: Former President of Cuba. Involved with the Department of Justice and scheduled to stand trial on arms smuggling charges, however he offers Soviet intelligence plans through Frank Jackson, causing suspicion within the CIA.
*   **Frank Jackson**: Public relations representative for Prio, believed to be connected with an organization known as World Surveys. He acts as a key intermediary, presenting the Prio group's offer of intelligence to U.S. authorities.

## Internal Conflicts and Security Concerns

*   **AMBARB Funding Disagreements**: Conflicts arose between AMSPELL and the CIA (JMWAVE) over the funding and control of AMBARB representatives, highlighting tensions in the relationship.
*   **G-2 Penetration**: Concerns about Cuban intelligence (G-2) infiltrating AMSPELL, with individuals like Jorge MEDINA Bringuier identified as potential double agents.
*   **Security Breaches**: Instances of arrests and missing members within AMSPELL's clandestine organization in Cuba, indicating severe security challenges.

## Propaganda and Intelligence Activities

*   **Psywar Operations**: AMHINTs inside Cuba continued to produce propaganda, such as the "Trinchera" newspaper, to disseminate anti-Castro messages and counter-information.
*   **Intelligence Production**: AMSPELL generated intelligence reports on various aspects of the Cuban regime, including the status of equipment at the Nico Lopez Refinery and Soviet/Bloc assistance.
*   **Diplomatic Pouches**: Interception of diplomatic pouches revealed AMSPELL's operational planning, including negotiations for an operations base and intelligence requirements for attacks on Cuban ports.

## AMSPELL's Latin America Tour: Successes and Failures

*   **Purpose**: AMSPELL undertook a tour of Latin American countries to promote anti-Castro sentiments and garner support.
*   **Results**: The tour had mixed results. While some locations, like Guayaquil and La Paz, saw significant success, others, such as Quito, Santiago, and Montevideo, were considered failures due to poor organization, lack of local support, and political opposition.

## Supporting Cuban Rebels

*   **Dominican Republic Support**: Craft manned by Cuban exiles were allowed to cache arms and other supplies on the Dominican coast with the support of the Dominican Air Force and Navy, under the direction of Air Force Col. Juan N. Folch Perelo.

## Key Events and Operations

*   **August 24th Attack on Havana**: AMSPELL had planned the Havana attack for six months, using it as a catalyst for influencing public opinion and pressuring the U.S. government for action.
*   **Exfiltration of AMHINT-53**: A significant event that shifted negotiations with AMSPELL from AMHINT-2 to AMHINT-53.
*   **The Bay of Pigs**: Was still in recent history and very present in these operations.

## Concluding Summary and Implications

The declassified documents illustrate the multifaceted and often complex nature of the CIA's covert operations against Cuba during the early to mid-1960s. The relationship with Cuban exile groups like AMSPELL was fraught with internal conflicts, security risks, and varying degrees of success. The CIA's objectives were to destabilize the Castro regime through propaganda, intelligence gathering, and paramilitary actions. However, the documents also reveal the challenges of maintaining control over these operations and the potential for infiltration by Cuban intelligence. These operations had significant implications for U.S.-Cuba relations and contributed to the ongoing tensions and conflicts between the two countries.

## Simplified Explanation for Readers Unfamiliar with the JFK Files

Imagine a real-life spy movie set in the 1960s, where the U.S. government, through the CIA, is secretly trying to undermine Fidel Castro's communist government in Cuba. These documents are like behind-the-scenes memos and reports that give us a peek into this covert operation.

**What's Going On?**

The U.S. government was worried about Cuba becoming a communist stronghold so close to American soil. So, they decided to work secretly with Cuban exiles—people who had fled Cuba after Castro took over—to fight back.

**Who Are the Key Players?**

*   **The CIA**: Like the director of a movie, the CIA was organizing and funding these secret operations.
*   **Cuban Exile Groups (like AMSPELL)**: These were groups of Cuban exiles who wanted to overthrow Castro. They were like the actors in the movie, carrying out the plans.
*   **Double Agents**: Some people pretended to be on the U.S. side but were actually spies for Castro.

**What Were They Doing?**

*   **Spreading Propaganda**: Like creating fake news, they spread negative information about Castro to make Cubans turn against him.
*   **Gathering Intelligence**: They tried to find out what Castro was planning and what the Soviet Union (Russia) was doing in Cuba.
*   **Secret Raids**: Some groups even launched small attacks on Cuba to disrupt the government.

**What Were the Problems?**

*   **Trust Issues**: It was hard to know who to trust. Some exiles were secretly working for Castro.
*   **Money Problems**: There were disagreements about who got the money and how it was spent.
*   **Not Always Successful**: Some of the operations were poorly planned and failed, making the U.S. look bad.

**Why Is This Important?**

These secret operations show the lengths the U.S. government went to in trying to get rid of Castro. They also highlight the dangers of working with secret groups and the challenges of keeping operations secret. It is important to understand all these operations to fully get a sense of what led to JFK's murder and the climate in 1963.
