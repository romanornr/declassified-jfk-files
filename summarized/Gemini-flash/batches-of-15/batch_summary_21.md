# CIA Covert Operations and Personnel: A Consolidated Summary of Declassified Documents

This summary compiles information from a series of declassified CIA documents pertaining to the establishment and maintenance of cover identities for agency personnel and assets. The documents span from 1957 to 1967 and shed light on the processes, procedures, and individuals involved in these operations, including activities related to Cuba and the Soviet Union.

## Establishment and Management of Cover Identities

Several documents detail the process of establishing and managing cover identities for CIA personnel. These covers were essential for concealing the true affiliations of individuals engaged in sensitive operations.

*   **Military Cover Backstop:** Documents 104-10161-10001, 104-10161-10115, and 104-10161-10154 outline the establishment and cancellation of military cover for Joseph S. Piccolo.
    *   Form 1551 (Document 104-10161-10001) notifies the Records and Services Division of the establishment of a military cover backstop for Piccolo, dated "109709" (interpreted as September 10, 1957). This included blocking records and ensuring the issuance of an Army W-2 form.
    *   Form 1322 (Document 104-10161-10115), dated June 11, 1963, cancels Piccolo's military cover, instructing the return of all military documentation.
    *   Form 1551 (Document 104-10161-10154), dated August 15, 1961, again establishes an official cover backstop for Joseph E. Piccolo, noting that all information is available through Military Cover, CCG (Central Cover Group).
*   **Nominal State Cover:** A memorandum dated September 28, 1961 (Document 104-10161-10144), discusses Joseph S. Piccolo's use of nominal state cover in Mexico from November 1, 1957, to January 14, 1960, and Department of the Army cover from January 15, 1961, until his resignation on October 4, 1961. Piccolo was instructed to identify his employer as CIA, 2430 E Street, N.W., Washington 25, D.C., and to obscure the details of his cover assignment when discussing travel.
*   **Non-Official Cover:** Documents 104-10161-10330 and 104-10161-10331 detail the establishment of non-official cover for Peter J. DiGervino for an assignment in Madrid, Spain, in June 1967. Security files were checked for any declarations or compromises to foreign governments or intelligence services.
* **Travel Processing Sheet:** A travel processing sheet (Document 104-10161-10193) for Teddik Piccilly, a Mast/liff GS-5, reveals his upcoming departure to Mexico City on January 14, 1959. Prior to the departure a review of the subject's file was conducted and the subject was interviewed regarding knowledge of security regulations in general, travel precautions, cover story, personal affairs, and defensive audio-surveillance matters.

These documents illustrate the meticulous nature of establishing and maintaining cover identities, involving coordination between various CIA departments and adherence to strict security protocols.

## Activities Related to Cuba and the Soviet Union

Several documents suggest CIA involvement in activities related to Cuba and the Soviet Union.

*   **Cuban Documentation:** Documents 104-10162-10107 and 104-10162-10108 detail the transmittal of Cuban documentation, including a passport, exit permit (Vigencia), and international certificate of vaccination, for Manuel Artime y Buesa in January 1961. The Cuban passport contained a U.S. Non-Immigrant Visa valid until May 17, 1964, and the subject was admitted to the U.S. on June 16, 1960, with an extension of stay until March 15, 1961.
*   **Santiago Alvarez Fernandez:** Documents 104-10162-10120 and 104-10162-10121 concern Santiago Alvarez Fernandez, residing in Miami, Florida. He was the subject of a "Green List" request in January 1961 and the request included derogatory information and an evaluation.
*   **Soviet Interest:** Document 104-10162-10014 refers to Ivan Gavrilevich Alferov, who requested an Argentine visa for travel to Buenos Aires for temporary duty at the Soviet Embassy in October 1958. Headquarters traces were conducted on Alferov.
*   **Vladimir Rodriguez Lahera:** Document 104-10161-10226 concerns WHD asset, Vladimir Rodriguez Lahera, who resided in an apartment procured by the Safehouse Branch, Office of Logistics. Ostensibly, the apartment was acquired for the purpose of providing quarters for out of town clients, etc. On August 7, 1964 Lahera claimed to have made a long distance phone call from the apartment to a cousin. It was requested that the agency verify if this call was actually made, including the time at which the call was made.

These documents indicate CIA interest in Cuban exiles, Soviet officials, and related activities during the Cold War era.

## Conclusion

The declassified CIA documents provide a glimpse into the agency's covert operations, particularly the establishment and maintenance of cover identities. These covers were crucial for protecting personnel and assets engaged in sensitive missions around the world. The documents highlight the meticulous processes involved, the coordination between various CIA departments, and the strict adherence to security protocols. Individuals like Joseph S. Piccolo and Peter J. DiGervino were provided with carefully constructed cover stories and documentation to conceal their true affiliations.

The information contained in these documents offers valuable insights into the inner workings of the CIA and its efforts to safeguard national security during a turbulent period in history.

## JFK Files for Dummies

Okay, so imagine you're watching a spy movie, right? These documents are like behind-the-scenes notes about how the spies make sure no one knows they're spies. This bunch of documents from the CIA talks about creating fake identities ("covers") for their agents.

**What's the Big Picture?**

During the Cold War (a tense time between the US and the Soviet Union), the CIA needed to do secret stuff all over the world. To do that, their agents couldn't just walk around saying, "Hi, I'm a spy!" They needed to blend in. That's where "covers" came in.

**Key Things to Know:**

*   **Fake Jobs:** The CIA would make it look like their agents had normal jobs (like in the military or with some company). That way, if anyone asked, they had a believable story.
*   **Paperwork, Paperwork, Paperwork:** These documents are mostly about the forms and procedures the CIA used to create and manage these fake identities. It's like the agency was really careful to cover their tracks and keep everything organized.
*   **People:** The documents mention specific people who had these fake identities (like Joseph S. Piccolo and Peter J. DiGervino). They also mention some people the CIA was keeping an eye on, like Soviet officials and Cuban exiles.
*   **Places:** Some of the action happened in places like Mexico, Spain, and Cuba. The CIA was interested in what was going on in those countries.
*   **Cuba and Soviets:** This was at the height of the Cold War, when everyone was extremely concerned with what the Soviets were doing and right after the communist take over of Cuba and the subsequent Bay of Pigs invasion.

**Why Does This Matter?**

These documents show how the CIA operated in secret during a really important time in history. They give us a glimpse into the world of spies and how they tried to stay hidden while doing their jobs. It's kind of like peeking behind the curtain to see how the magic trick is done. They also show how much the CIA was focused on Cuba and the Soviets.
