# Classified CIA Operations: A Summary of Declassified Documents

This summary synthesizes several declassified CIA documents related to various operations, intelligence gathering activities, and internal concerns. The documents span from the early 1960s through the mid-1970s, providing a glimpse into the agency's focus on Cuba, counterintelligence efforts, and internal security protocols.

## African Student Protests in Moscow (December 1963)

*   **Incident:** Approximately 500 African students in Moscow protested at the Ghana Embassy and marched to the Kremlin on December 18, 1963.
*   **Reason:** They were protesting the alleged killing of a Ghanaian student, Asaro Addeo, and racist attitudes in the Soviet Union.
*   **Student Claims:** Students carried placards with slogans such as "Stop Killing Africans" and "Moscow is Second Alabama." They claimed their freedom was threatened due to beatings and the recent death in Kalinin.
*   **Soviet Response:** Soviet officials claimed Addeo died of exposure while intoxicated. Students believed he was killed for wanting to marry a Russian girl.
*   **CIA's Perspective:** The CIA saw the incident as evidence of racist attitudes despite Soviet propaganda efforts, linking the incident to the recent expulsion of Soviet diplomats from the Congo. The CIA planned to exploit this event through FBIS sources to highlight Soviet duplicity and subversion in African states.

## Tracking Tadeusz Szulc: Allegations of Communist Sympathies (June 1962)

*   **Subject:** Tadeusz Szulc, a Polish-American journalist.
*   **Allegations:** Szulc was suspected of having pro-communist sympathies in the 1940s and early 1950s, with reports indicating he provided information to the Polish Legation in Rio de Janeiro.
*   **Connection to Ignacy Sachs:** Szulc allegedly cooperated with Ignacy Sachs, a cousin employed by the Press Section of the Polish Embassy, providing him with information.
*   **Family Ties:** Szulc's uncle, John Wiley, was the U.S. Ambassador to Panama, and Szulc used these connections to gain access and gather information, some of which was reportedly passed to Polish authorities.
*   **Assessment:** While Szulc seemingly wasn't hiding his relationship with Sachs, it was considered unwise to dismiss the collaboration as not being espionage-related.

## Project AMTRUNK: Overthrowing Castro (March-April 1963)

*   **Objective:** To overthrow the Cuban government through a coup led by high-level military and civilian leaders.
*   **Mission Structure:** The operation was divided into two phases:
    *   **Phase One:** Black infiltration of AMTRUNK/2 and AMTRUNK/3 into Havana to establish contacts within the Rebel Army.
    *   **Phase Two:** Black infiltration of AMICE/27 and AMICE/14 into the Matanzas area to organize a ratline into Havana and recruit key individuals.
*   **Personnel Issues:** The report highlights concerns about the agents' anti-CIA sentiments (specifically anti-KUBARK), potential for collaboration with rival exile groups, and security risks. Some agents demonstrated questionable security practices and loose talk.
*   **Infiltration Risks:** High risks associated with the landing points (near cruise missile sites) and the lack of control over the agents once inside Cuba.
*   **Recommendation:** JMWAVE Station recommended the termination of Project AMTRUNK due to the significant risks and control issues.

## Operational Plan Against Cuba: Long-Term Strategy (November 1962)

*   **Context:** Following the Cuban Missile Crisis, the plan aimed to continue and intensify intelligence efforts against Cuba while reorienting operations for the long term.
*   **Assumptions:** The U.S. government would provide assurances against invading Cuba if certain conditions were met. This limited the CIA's ability to provoke a revolt or use contrived provocations.
*   **Objectives:**
    *   Isolate the Castro regime.
    *   Discredit the regime.
    *   Maintain economic and political pressures.
    *   Maximize intelligence and counterintelligence coverage.
    *   Induce a split in the Cuban regime.
*   **Operational Tactics:** Espionage, intelligence collection, third-country operations, liaison operations, maritime operations, penetration of Cuban installations, and psychological warfare.
*   **Proposed Changes:** Gradual reduction in Task Force W's expenditures and personnel and abolishment of the operational Mongoose mechanism.

## Howard Hunt Investigation: Financial Records (February 1974)

*   **Inquiry:** An Office of Finance search for any undocumented $30,000 payment to Howard Hunt.
*   **Findings:** No such payment was found in expense records, Madrid Station or JMWAVE accountings, or travel claims.
*   **Unusual Expenditure:** $1,600 was approved for write-off by Desmond Fitzgerald in June 1966 without further accounting, noted as a sensitive operation.
*   **Bank Accounts:** A Chase Manhattan bank account was opened for Hunt to receive non-salary payments, with $30,000 deposited in 1965-1966, fully accounted for by travel and transportation accountings.
*   **Strange Assignment:** All costs were charged to the EUR Division's support allotment, which is unusual for non-official cover personnel. Further investigation into possible projects is suggested.

## Rolando Masferrer: Risks to Miami Station (February 1967)

*   **Situation:** The Justice Department's decision to seek an indictment against Rolando Masferrer and his associates posed a threat to CIA activities in Miami.
*   **Publicity Concerns:** Heightened local press interest in CIA activities could lead to exposure of the Miami Station and its cover firms.
*   **University of Miami Cooperation:** Concerns that the President and Vice President of the University of Miami might face too much pressure to continue their cooperation with the CIA if a flood of negative publicity occurred.
*   **Defense Strategy Risks:** The defense could easily drag CIA Miami into the case, with disgruntled former agents possibly revealing details and rumors about CIA operations.

## Alfred J. Moran: JMWAVE Contact (May 1965)

*   **Role:** Alfred J. Moran, a wealthy New Orleans businessman, was used by JMWAVE (Miami).
*   **Cover Company:** Moran acted as the President of YOCOUGH, a JMWAVE cover company.
*   **Activities:** Moran provided funding mechanisms, spotted potential assets, and allowed his oil companies to be used for backstopping cover of JMWAVE operational vessels.
*   **Limited Exposure:** Moran knew specific JMWAVE personnel, cover companies, and vessels, but his exposure was limited.

## James Garrison: Bertrand Russell Peace Foundation (December 1967)

*   **Subject:** James Garrison, District Attorney, Orleans, Louisiana.
*   **Contact with Russell Foundation:** The Bertrand Russell Peace Foundation contacted Garrison to persuade him to write an article about the Kennedy assassination.
*   **Source:** MI-5 (British Security Service) provided the information.
*   **FBI Involvement:** MI-5 also passed the information to the Legal Attache (FBI representative) in London.

## JMWAVE Cover Facilities: Ace Marine Survey and Ceres Enterprises (March 1967)

*   **Ace Marine Survey, Inc.:** A Florida Corporation established to provide cover for the M/V SONORA. Funded through covert accounts, with its ostensible business being marine research.
*   **Ceres Enterprises, Inc.:** Established to maintain and operate boats for marine research. It provided cover for maritime vessels and served as the status and payroll mechanism for the agents employed by this corporation.
*   **Vulnerability Assessments:** Ace Marine Survey had a low-risk profile, while Ceres Enterprises was deemed more vulnerable due to an agent being captured in Cuba, leading to its inactivation.

## E. Howard Hunt: Security Deletions from Memoirs (September 1974)

*   **Context:** Review of E. Howard Hunt's manuscript "Undercover: Memoirs of an American Agent" for security breaches.
*   **Deletion Requests:** Multiple passages were flagged for deletion or revision, including those that identified covert personnel, described sensitive operations, revealed sources and methods, and jeopardized liaison relationships.
*   **Hard Core Items:** Specific items were designated as "hard core," meaning the Agency was prepared to litigate if Hunt refused to cooperate with their removal.

## Conclusion

These declassified documents reveal the multifaceted nature of CIA operations during the Cold War era. From monitoring student protests and tracking individuals suspected of communist sympathies to planning elaborate schemes to destabilize the Cuban government and managing complex cover operations, the documents illustrate the agency's global reach and its engagement in both overt and covert activities. Internal communications also highlight the constant need for security, the protection of sources and methods, and the management of relationships with foreign intelligence services.

## Making the Documents Understandable for a General Reader

Okay, here's a version that breaks down the essence of these CIA documents for someone completely new to the topic, avoiding jargon and focusing on the big picture:

**Title: Inside the CIA's Secret World: Cuba, Spies, and Hidden Operations**

Imagine the height of the Cold War. The world was divided, and the CIA was on the front lines, fighting a secret war against communism. These documents, once top secret, give us a glimpse into what that fight looked like. They reveal how the CIA operated, who they targeted, and the lengths they went to in their hidden battles.

**1. The African Student Protest:**

One document talks about African students protesting in Moscow back in 1963. Why is the CIA interested? Because they saw it as a chance to show that even the Soviet Union, which claimed to be a friend of Africa, was facing racism. The CIA hoped to use this to turn African nations against the Soviets. It’s a classic example of Cold War propaganda.

**2. Tracking a Journalist:**

Another document focuses on a journalist named Tadeusz Szulc. The CIA suspected him of being pro-communist based on information that he’d provided news to the Polish Embassy. Remember, this was a time of intense suspicion. Anyone with ties to communist countries was scrutinized. Even family ties, in this case to an ambassador, didn't guarantee safety from suspicion. This case shows how the CIA tracked individuals, looking for any hint of disloyalty.

**3. Overthrowing Castro (Project AMTRUNK):**

The most dramatic documents detail the CIA's attempts to overthrow Fidel Castro's communist government in Cuba. Project AMTRUNK was a plan to infiltrate agents into Cuba to start a coup (a sudden, illegal seizure of power). What’s striking is how much the CIA struggled to control their own agents. Some agents were openly against the CIA itself and the agency was worried about it's secrecy, showing the difficulties of working with groups that didn't fully trust the US. Ultimately, the CIA realized the risks were too high and considered shutting down the project.

**4. The Long Game Against Cuba:**

Even after the failed Bay of Pigs invasion and the Cuban Missile Crisis, the CIA didn't give up on Cuba. One document outlines a long-term strategy: isolate Cuba, discredit Castro, and put economic pressure on the country. They wanted to gather as much information as possible by spying on Cuban officials, recruiting agents, and listening in on phone calls.

**5. Money and Secrets: The Howard Hunt Case:**

The documents also touch on a scandal involving Howard Hunt, a key figure in the Watergate scandal. The CIA was looking into whether he received a secret $30,000 payment. This shows how the CIA dealt with its own internal issues, trying to track down money and keep secrets from getting out.

**6. Protecting the CIA: The Masferrer Threat:**

When Rolando Masferrer, a Cuban exile, faced legal trouble, the CIA worried that his trial could expose their operations in Miami. The documents reveal how the CIA tried to prevent information about its activities from becoming public, showing how the agency prioritized secrecy and self-preservation.

**7. The Importance of "Cover":**

To hide their activities, the CIA created fake companies. In one case, a wealthy businessman named Alfred J. Moran helped the CIA by letting them use his businesses as fronts. These cover companies allowed the CIA to operate in secret.

**8. The Kennedy Assassination and a District Attorney:**

Another document talks about Jim Garrison, a district attorney investigating the Kennedy assassination. The CIA learned that the Bertrand Russell Peace Foundation wanted Garrison to write an article about the assassination, suggesting an effort to influence his investigation.

**What Does It All Mean?**

These documents paint a picture of a powerful agency operating in the shadows, constantly trying to gather intelligence, influence events, and protect its secrets. They show the CIA's obsession with Cuba, their efforts to fight communism around the world, and the challenges they faced in maintaining secrecy and controlling their own agents. They also remind us that even in the most secret corners of government, internal investigations and scandals can occur. They show the realities of the Cold War through the activities of its many actors.
