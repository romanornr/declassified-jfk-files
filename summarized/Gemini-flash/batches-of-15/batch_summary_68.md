# Covert Operations and Containment: US Policy Towards Cuba, 1962-1965

This summary consolidates classified documents from the CIA and Department of Defense revealing the multifaceted approach the United States took toward Cuba in the early 1960s. These documents outline strategies for undermining the Castro regime, countering Cuban subversion in Latin America, and preparing for potential retaliatory actions by Cuba.

## Countering Cuban Subversion in Latin America (February 1963)

A CIA report from February 25, 1963, details Cuba's active role in promoting communist revolution throughout Latin America. The report emphasizes that Fidel Castro's government functioned as a modern-day Comintern, providing:

*   **Inspiration and Guidance:** Encouraging revolutionary movements through public pronouncements and propaganda.
*   **Training:** Offering courses in Cuba on underground organization techniques, guerrilla warfare, sabotage, and terrorism.
*   **Technical Assistance:** Providing communication methods and training aids.

The report highlights Venezuela as Cuba's top priority for revolution, with over 200 Venezuelans receiving guerrilla training in 1962. The Armed Forces of National Liberation (FALN) in Venezuela, supported by Cuba, engaged in sabotage and violence to destabilize the government.

Cuban subversion tactics included:

*   **Propaganda:** Massive dissemination of inflammatory broadcasts from Havana and distribution of texts on guerrilla warfare by Mao Tse-tung, Che Guevara, and Alberto Bayo.
*   **Training Camps:** Hosting at least 1,000-1,500 Latin Americans in 1962 for ideological indoctrination and guerrilla warfare training.
*   **Funding:** Providing cash to revolutionary groups, often transported by couriers.
*   **Propaganda Broadcasts:** Radio Havana Cuba transmitted 187 hours and 50 minutes weekly in multiple languages, promoting revolution and denouncing "Yankee imperialism."

The report also notes the ideological split between Cuba, aligned with Chinese Communist militancy, and the Soviet Union's more cautious approach. This division created rivalries among communist groups in Latin America.

## Project Mongoose: Covert Actions Against Cuba (January 1962)

A memorandum dated January 24, 1962, outlines tasks assigned to the CIA as part of "The Cuba Project," also known as Operation Mongoose. The document details 16 specific tasks assigned to the CIA, either solely or jointly with other US government entities and provides deadlines. These tasks focused on:

*   **Intelligence Gathering:** Improving intelligence on Cuba through various means, including the use of interrogation centers and third-country assets.
*   **Identifying Potential Defectors:** Locating and assessing Cuban officials who might be willing to defect.
*   **Covert Operations:** Developing plans for deception, sabotage, and psychological warfare against the Cuban government.
*   **Establishing a Resistance Movement:** Organizing and supporting an anti-Castro resistance within Cuba.
*   **Economic Disruption:** Plans to induce crop failures, disrupt the supply of Cuban nickel to the USSR, and sabotage key Cuban facilities.

Specific actions included:

*   Plans for the sinking of Cuban or Bloc ships.
*   "Frogman" or UDT (Underwater Demolition Team) tactics in harbors.
*   The use of torpedos and mines.
*   Sabotaging the Nicaro and Moa nickel plants.
*   Propaganda operations in Latin America to mobilize public opinion against Castro, and psychological operations, one of which was a TV intrusion in January 1962.

The documents reveal plans for intensive and wide-ranging operations aimed at destabilizing the Cuban regime through covert means.

## Potential Cuban Retaliation and US Response (June 1965)

A memorandum from June 26, 1965, discusses possible retaliatory actions by the Castro government in response to Cuban exile raids. It outlines the status of existing contingency plans and assesses the likelihood of various Cuban actions.

Key points include:

*   **Guantanamo Security:** Detailed defensive measures to protect the U.S. Naval Base at Guantanamo Bay against harassment, including maintaining water reserves, providing a tailored Naval Construction Battalion, and outlining responses to demonstrations, sniping, and sabotage.
*   **Rules of Engagement:** Guidelines for U.S. forces regarding harassment of U.S. shipping and aircraft, emphasizing defensive measures and limiting authorized actions.
*   **Contingency Plans:** Existing military plans for responding to attacks on areas in Latin America used by Cuban exiles, subject to U.S. government approval.
*   **Retaliatory Plans:** Military plans, retaliatory in nature, which range up to and include a full scale military invasion of Cuba.

The assessment concludes that Castro was more likely to intensify support for subversive forces in Latin America than to provoke direct confrontation with the United States. This approach was seen as less likely to trigger immediate U.S. retaliation while still advancing Cuban objectives.

The document also refers to an informal meeting of the Interdepartmental Subcommittee (Psychological Programs) on Cuban Affairs convened in December 1963 to discuss actions related to CUTAL (Unified Labor Federation for Latin America). It includes potential disruptive actions before and during the meeting in Rio de Janeiro, and ways to discourage country delegates from attending the meeting.

## Conclusion

These documents paint a picture of an aggressive and multifaceted U.S. strategy toward Cuba in the early to mid-1960s. Operation Mongoose sought to destabilize the Castro regime through covert actions, sabotage, and psychological warfare. Simultaneously, the U.S. government worked to counter Cuban subversion in Latin America by identifying and disrupting Cuban support networks for revolutionary movements. Recognizing the potential for Cuban retaliation, the U.S. developed contingency plans to protect U.S. assets and respond to various provocations. The assessment of potential Cuban actions indicates a preference for indirect confrontation through support for Latin American insurgents, deemed less likely to trigger a direct U.S. military response. Overall, these documents highlight the intense focus and wide-ranging efforts of the U.S. government to contain and undermine the Cuban revolution during this period.

## A Simplified Explanation for Non-Experts

Okay, imagine these documents are pieces of a puzzle about what the US government was doing about Cuba in the early 1960s, shortly after Fidel Castro took over. At the time, the US was very worried about the spread of communism, and Cuba was a new communist country right in its backyard.

Here's the big picture:

*   **Cuba Was Spreading Communism:** The US believed Cuba was actively trying to cause communist revolutions in other Latin American countries. Cuba was providing training, money, and propaganda to these groups.
*   **The US Wanted to Stop Cuba:** The US government developed a secret plan called "Operation Mongoose" to destabilize Castro's government. This involved things like sabotage, spreading false information, and even considering attacks on Cuban ships.
*   **Preparing for the Worst:** The US military was also preparing for the possibility that Cuba would retaliate against the US. They had plans to protect the Guantanamo Bay naval base and to respond to any attacks on US ships or planes.
*   **A War of Ideas:** The US and Cuba were also fighting a "psychological war." Cuba used radio broadcasts to spread its message, while the US tried to counter this with its own propaganda.

Think of it like this: the US saw Cuba as a threat and was trying to contain it through a combination of secret operations, military planning, and propaganda. The documents show the many different ways the US government was working to undermine Castro's regime and prevent the spread of communism in Latin America.

The goal of the actions was not necessarily a full scale war, the intention was to destabilize the country and cause infighting and unrest that would eventually lead to a civil war.
