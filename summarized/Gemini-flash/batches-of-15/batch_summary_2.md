*   The letter indicates that the CIA anticipated pressure for the release of Warren Commission papers, but the pressure had not materialized at the time.

# Explanation for a Reader Unfamiliar with the JFK Files

Okay, imagine you're trying to solve a really old and complicated mystery. These CIA documents are like scattered pieces of a puzzle related to the JFK assassination. They don't give you the whole picture, but they offer clues about what the CIA was doing behind the scenes.

Here's a breakdown of the key takeaways, explained in a way that avoids jargon:

*   **Information Control:** The CIA was *very* protective of its secrets. They didn't want information about the Kennedy assassination getting out if it could damage the agency, so they tried to control what was released to the public.

*   **Oswald's Connections:** There was a lot of investigation into Lee Harvey Oswald, the guy who shot Kennedy. The CIA wanted to know if he was connected to the Soviet KGB (the Russian spy agency), but a KGB official said Oswald was not an agent.

*   **Spies and Journalists:** The CIA sometimes used journalists to spread certain stories or gather information. This was a sneaky way of influencing the news and finding out what was happening.

*   **Tracking People:** The CIA had a system (called the "201 system") for tracking people they were interested in. They would collect information on these people, assign them a number, and keep files on them.

*   **Suspicious Figures:** The documents mention people who were considered "of interest" to the CIA. Some of these people had connections to Cuba, Russia, or other countries that were considered enemies of the U.S. during the Cold War.

*   **Internal Investigations:** The CIA investigated its own people to make sure they were trustworthy. This was especially important in high-profile cases like the Kennedy assassination.

*   **Cooperation with Other Agencies:** The CIA worked with intelligence agencies in other countries, like Australia and France, to gather information and share secrets.

In essence, these documents provide snapshots of the CIA's efforts to understand what happened with JFK assassination, manage the flow of information, and protect its own interests. They don't definitively solve the mystery, but they add more layers to a complex and controversial event in history.
