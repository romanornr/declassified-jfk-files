# Covert Operations and Contacts in Mexico City, 1963

This summary consolidates classified CIA documents from September and October 1963, focusing on activities in Mexico City, Cuba, and related international locations. The documents reveal ongoing efforts to gather intelligence, cultivate potential assets, and disrupt Cuban shipping, amidst a backdrop of Cold War tensions and concerns about Communist influence.

## Identification and Recruitment of Potential Assets

Several documents focus on identifying and approaching potential assets. Key individuals and operations mentioned include:

*   **Giulio Mondello:** An Italian citizen and former FIAT agent in Cuba, residing in Italy (Rome). The CIA sought information on him, referencing code words "KAPOK" and "KEYHAY."
*   **José Luis (ZALA):** Possibly linked to "Ultimas Novedades S.A." in Mexico City. He was registered for "AFOZEER service," and the CIA sought information from his 201 file.
*   **Alfonso Bibiliox:** Subject of inquiry originating from PARIS/L/PIPIT. The document references MEDURIC and EXPITODE, hinting at covert programs.
*   **Alfredo Davins:** The CIA sought to confirm his identity, referencing code words "AMLONG" and "RONIS."
*   **Liang Szu-Ch'eng:** A Chinese architect and member of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) who had studied in the U.S. The CIA considered him a potential defector and planned to approach him during his visit to Mexico City for a conference. The document details his background, including his education at Tsinghua University, University of Pennsylvania, and Harvard, as well as his past "self-criticism" to the CCP. The operation involved using "STPLATE 1," who was arriving in Mexico City on October 12, 1963, to establish contact.
*   **Yang Ting-Pao:** Another member of the Chinese delegation, approached by a former partner for "assessment."
*   **Wu Ching-Hsiang:** A member of the Chinese delegation whose U.S. citizen brother was arriving to gauge his interest in remaining in the "free world".

## Sabotage Operations Against Cuban Shipping

The documents reveal plans and concerns related to sabotaging Cuban shipping:

*   **Hurricane Flora's Impact:** Damage from Hurricane Flora to Cuba was expected to increase the volume of food and medicine shipments, altering the "percentages and psychological impact" of sabotage operations. This led to a temporary suspension of operations and a reassessment of approach. The documents reference plans for sabotaging "Rio Cronso."
*   **Attempted Sabotage of "Las Villas":** A ticker item from Fidel Castro's October 21 speech reported the discovery of an attempted sabotage of the Cuban merchant ship "Las Villas." Castro claimed the CIA placed a defective bomb on the vessel in Genoa, Italy. The CIA's policy was "no comment and complete denial."

## Covert Communication and Support

The documents highlight the infrastructure supporting covert operations:

*   **Secure Communication Channels:** The documents reference secure communication channels like RYBAT, TYPIC, and ANSOUR, used for transmitting sensitive information between different CIA stations.
*   **Operational Funds and Logistics:** The documents authorize the use of operational funds and per diem for agents like STPLATE 1. They also mention logistical support, such as the delivery of cartridges to Corpus Christi.
*   **Mail Intercepts:** A letter to AMSOUR-2 being mailed to Sr. Juan Gomez Blanco in PERUMEN, suggesting mail intercepts were a part of information gathering.
*   **Ash & Company and Overseas Realty Survey Associates:** Listed as IDEN A and IDEN B, these may be cover companies or entities somehow linked to CIA operations in Mexico City.

## Surveillance and Intelligence Gathering

*   **Michel Chidiac:** Identified as the Lebanese Charge in Havana. His recent travel was tracked, referencing MEXI 5954 and 6008.
*   **Hotel Espionage:** The CIA considered placing an asset in a high-level position at "Hoteles Internacionales," potentially for espionage purposes.
*   **Richard Walker:** Chairman of the Department of International Relations at the University of South Carolina, mentioned in relation to "KAPOK LCHARVEST" possibly as a cover.

## Conclusion and Implications

These documents paint a picture of intense CIA activity in Mexico City during September and October 1963. The Agency was actively involved in identifying, assessing, and attempting to recruit potential assets from various backgrounds, including Chinese academics and individuals with connections to Cuba. Simultaneously, the CIA was planning and, potentially, executing sabotage operations against Cuban shipping, despite setbacks caused by unforeseen circumstances like Hurricane Flora. The documents underscore the complex and multifaceted nature of Cold War intelligence operations, involving intricate networks of agents, secure communication channels, and logistical support systems. The operations aimed to gather intelligence, influence individuals, and disrupt the activities of perceived adversaries. The implications of these findings highlight the pervasive nature of Cold War espionage and the lengths to which the U.S. government was willing to go to counter perceived threats.
