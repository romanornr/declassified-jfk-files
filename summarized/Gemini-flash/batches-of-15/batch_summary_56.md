The author, using the alias "Antilin PERIS," claimed to have an "authentic document" about the assassination, allegedly stolen from the Warren Commission, which was prejudicial to President Johnson. The letter suggested the document was in Paris and attempts were being made to sell it to *Paris-Match* magazine, with possible involvement from someone at the British Embassy in Paris.
    *   The CIA's Paris office and the High General Staff (HGS) in Madrid were involved in trying to identify the sender and investigate the claims.

## Anghel Dragomir Interview and Potential Connections

*   **Interview of Anghel Dragomir (August 21, 1964):** The FBI, through its Legat (Legal Attaché) in Bern, Switzerland, coordinated with the Research Branch (Covert CIA) at the U.S. Embassy in Vienna, Austria, to interview ANGHEL DRAGOMIR.

    *   Information about DRAGOMIR from Bureau files was intentionally excluded because his identity had not been proven.
