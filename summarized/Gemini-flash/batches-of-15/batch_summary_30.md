# The CIA's Covert Operations and Surveillance of Cuban Exiles and Diplomats (1958-1970)

This summary compiles classified CIA documents spanning from 1958 to 1970, revealing the agency's extensive efforts to monitor, influence, and potentially destabilize the Cuban regime under Fidel Castro. These documents detail various covert operations, surveillance activities, and interactions with Cuban exiles, showcasing the complex strategies employed by the CIA during this period.

## Early Intelligence Gathering (1958-1960)

*   **Monitoring Rebel Activity (December 1958):** A dispatch from Havana in December 1958 indicates the CIA was actively tracking the movements of Ernesto "Che" Guevara and his forces in the Las Villas province. Guevara's objective was believed to be cutting off the central highway west of Santa Clara. Additionally, the 26th of July Movement was reported to be replacing labor officials on captured sugar centrales, and Manuel Ray, chief of the MRC, was visiting the Sierra Maestra for a conference with Fidel Castro.
*   **Identifying Potential Assets (October 1960):** A message from the Director to the JHASH HAVARA requests biographical data on Juan Estevez Ramiros, indicating an attempt to gather intelligence for potential recruitment or assessment purposes. The message also lists several names (CRAFTED AMBARO, UIRERA VALDES, MORFFI MACHADO, ROS PEREZ, and FERNANDEZ BETANCOURT), suggesting a broader effort to identify individuals of interest within the Cuban diaspora.

## Engaging with Cuban Exile Groups (1961-1963)

*   **Manolo Ray and the MRP (October 1961):** Telegrams from London in October 1961 detail the views of Manolo Ray, leader of the Movimiento Revolucionario del Pueblo (MRP), regarding the overthrow of Castro. Ray opposed an invasion, believing that internal resistance, which he claimed was already underway and supported by a significant portion of the Cuban population, was the key. He claimed the MRP had members in trade unions, the G-2 (Cuban intelligence), the militia, and throughout the administration.
*   **JURE and AMBANG-1 (1962-1963):**
    *   **Cira Martinez Report (November 1962):** A report from JMWAVE provides information on Cira Martinez, a confidante of Manuel Ray. Martinez, using the pseudonym "Josefina," was reportedly dissatisfied with Ray's political actions and critical of the JURE organization. She described JURE as a political movement similar to Castroism, aiming to unite anti-Batista and anti-Castro organizations under a nationalistic and anti-American policy.
    *   **AMBANG-1's Activities (August 1963):** A memorandum details a meeting with AMBANG-1 (likely a code name for Manuel Ray), a key figure in the JURE, in Miami in July 1963. AMBANG-1 requested high explosives for a sabotage operation against the Havana power plant and sought assistance in arranging a contact in Guantanamo. He also outlined his political plans, including establishing a base in Santo Domingo and seeking support from President Juan Bosch. Additionally, he expressed concern over the suspension of PAA flights, which he considered a lifeline to his assets inside Cuba. He wanted to establish a San Juan-Caracas-Miami radio link.
    *   **European Outreach (June 1963):** Messages from Paris in June 1963 indicate that Ray was contacted by individuals under aliases (JERVAY, UNRUMBLE 6, UNPAPIST, and AMSPORT 1). Ray designated UNRUMBLE 6 as his contact man in Paris. He also sought to recruit Cuban diplomats like Franqui and Arcos and requested a list of Cuban embassies in Europe to initiate propaganda efforts. The CIA also offered to arrange a job for Cabrera as a European representative.
*   **Visa Facilitation (August 1962):** A message from Mexico City discusses the difficulty of obtaining Mexican visas for Cubans and outlines potential methods, including using high-level Mexican officials or Cuban friends with Mexican contacts. The document also mentions the LITEMPO visa channel, suggesting its use for facilitating the entry of individuals of interest into Mexico.
*   **Training Efforts in Costa Rica (April 1962):** A message from San Jose reveals that an individual known as "IOS," posing as an "engineering consultant," inquired about Manolo Ray's training efforts in Costa Rica, indicating Costa Rican government concerns about JURE's activities in the region.
* Rogelio Rodriquez Lopez:
    * PGT informant (March 1962): Victor Manuel Gutierrez revealed in an intel report that he met Rogelio Rodriquez Lopez, who told him that "the person from Cuba who is going to take over relations with Guatemala here in Mexico, still had not arrived". Rodriquez told Gutierrez that he planned to see Major Alfonso Prera, a leader of the November Group in Mexico, on 24 March.
    * Travels (March 1962): Rogelio Rodriquez Lopez left Mexico (PCS) on 4 May 1962 and Manuel E. VEGA Perez replaced Rogelio RODRIGUEZ in the Cuban Embassy
    *Cuban embassy informant said Rogelio Rodriquez Lopez arrived in Mexico on 3 September 1962.

## Technical Support and Sabotage Capabilities (1963-1964)

*   **Radio Switch Equipment (January 1964):** A memorandum discusses the acquisition of radio switch equipment for demolition firing purposes, recommending specific companies (Motorola, Kell) with experience in producing reliable equipment for special purposes. The document also mentions the possibility of using inexpensive equipment for short-range communications, with added mechanical protection against accidental triggering.
*   **AMBANG-1's Training (August 1963):** A memorandum details that AMBANG-1 was trained in a simple scorch system for secure writing by a WAVE technician. He was provided with materials to create the ink for this system, intended for communication with his delegate in Paris and other members of the JURE.

## Monitoring Cuban Diplomats and DGI Activity (1970)

*   **Cuban Mission Analysis (April 1970):** A dispatch analyzes the Cuban Mission to the United Nations (CMUN) and the DGI (Cuban intelligence) Center in New York. It identifies a significant number of DGI personnel within the CMUN roster and notes the impending departure of several key officers, potentially leading to a cutback in operational activity. The document also lists the names and positions of individuals within the CMUN and their affiliations.

## Other Operations:
*   **Removal from CAC:** A dispatch reveals that an unnamed subject was removed from CAC and debriefed to determine any relationship to the Cuban C-2 or other security organizations. The subject, described as a "sharp operator" and an "opportunist," claimed to have no connection to the Cuban C-2 but admitted to engaging in criminal activities in Los Angeles, California.
*   **Bavaria Resistance Group (October 1963):** A message discusses the sharing of information on a resistance group in Bavaria with a liaison group, indicating CIA interest in anti-communist resistance movements outside of Cuba.

## Conclusion

These documents collectively illustrate the CIA's multifaceted approach to countering the Cuban revolution. From gathering intelligence on key figures and rebel movements to engaging with and supporting Cuban exile groups, the agency sought to destabilize the Castro regime through both direct and indirect means. Technical support for sabotage operations and the monitoring of Cuban diplomats further underscore the intensity of the Cold War struggle as it played out in the shadows. The documents reveal a complex web of interactions, highlighting the challenges and strategies involved in covert operations during this period. The efforts to cultivate assets, disseminate propaganda, and potentially instigate internal resistance demonstrate the comprehensive nature of the CIA's anti-Castro campaign. The implications of these activities extend beyond Cuba, reflecting the broader geopolitical tensions and ideological conflicts of the Cold War era.

## Making the CIA documents understandable for a reader who has never read the JFK files

Imagine you're watching a spy movie set during the Cold War, but instead of just watching, you're piecing together the real story from secret documents. These documents, recently declassified, show the CIA's intense efforts to keep tabs on and potentially undermine Fidel Castro's communist government in Cuba from the late 1950s to the 1970s.

**What's the Big Picture?**

After Castro took power in 1959, the U.S. government saw Cuba as a threat, especially because of its close ties with the Soviet Union. The CIA was tasked with gathering information, influencing events, and even trying to overthrow Castro. This summary reveals some of the methods and people involved in this secret war.

**Key Players and Groups:**

*   **Fidel Castro:** The leader of Cuba's communist revolution, seen as the "bad guy" by the U.S. government.
*   **CIA:** The U.S. spy agency, working to collect intelligence and carry out secret operations against Castro's regime.
*   **Cuban Exiles:** People who fled Cuba after Castro came to power. Some of these exiles were recruited by the CIA to help with their anti-Castro efforts.
*   **Manolo Ray:** An important leader of a Cuban exile group called the Movimiento Revolucionario del Pueblo (MRP). The CIA communicated with him to gather intelligence.
*   **JURE:** Another Cuban exile organization that the CIA was interested in.
*   **AMBANG-1:** A code name for someone (likely Manolo Ray) involved with JURE. The CIA used code names to protect the identities of their contacts.
*   **DGI:** The Cuban intelligence agency, like Cuba's version of the CIA. The CIA was closely watching its agents in the U.S.

**What the Documents Show:**

*   **Early Intelligence:** The CIA was tracking the movements of Che Guevara, a key figure in the Cuban revolution, even before Castro took power.
*   **Recruiting Informants:** The CIA tried to find people who might be willing to provide information or help with their operations. They looked for people with access to the Cuban government or with connections to exile groups.
*   **Exile Groups:** The CIA communicated with and sometimes supported Cuban exile groups like the MRP and JURE. They wanted to use these groups to gather intelligence, spread propaganda, and potentially launch attacks against Cuba.
*   **Sabotage:** The CIA considered sabotage operations, such as blowing up a power plant in Havana. They even sought to obtain explosives.
*   **Monitoring Diplomats:** The CIA kept a close eye on Cuban diplomats working at the United Nations in New York. They wanted to know who they were, what they were doing, and if any of them might be willing to defect (switch sides).
*   **Technical Support:** The CIA provided equipment and training to help exile groups communicate secretly and carry out sabotage.

**Think of it Like This:**

Imagine the CIA as a detective trying to solve a case, with Castro as the suspect. They gathered clues (intelligence), interviewed witnesses (Cuban exiles), and considered various plans (sabotage, propaganda) to bring down the suspect.

**Why It Matters:**

These documents provide a glimpse into the secret history of the Cold War and the intense struggle between the U.S. and Cuba. They show the lengths to which the CIA was willing to go to undermine Castro's regime. They also raise questions about the ethics of covert operations and the impact of these activities on the people involved.
