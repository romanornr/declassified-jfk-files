# Vietnam in Turmoil: U.S. Involvement and the Diem Regime's Instability (1962-1963)

This summary consolidates classified CIA documents from 1962 and 1963, revealing the escalating tensions in South Vietnam, the growing instability of the Ngo Dinh Diem regime, and the complex dynamics of U.S. involvement. The documents highlight potential coups, communist activities, internal government conflicts, and the deteriorating relationship between the U.S. and South Vietnam, ultimately setting the stage for future events.

## Early Concerns and Potential Coup (June 1962)

*   A June 15, 1962, telegram indicates that Colonel Ton That Xung, Commander of the Ranger Command, expressed the view that the South Vietnamese people were "getting tired of the present situation" and that action would be taken to change it.
*   Xung stated that the plans would not be communicated to the Americans because the United States, being a law-abiding nation, would be opposed to such "unlawful acts" as a coup d'état.
*   This suggests a growing sentiment within the South Vietnamese military against the Diem regime and a desire to exclude the U.S. from any potential overthrow.

## Communist Activities in Saigon (August 1962)

*   An August 23, 1962, report details increased Vietnamese Communist (VC) activity in the Saigon area.
*   More than 500 unarmed VC infiltrated Saigon in June 1962, residing in the homes of fellow VC.
*   A VC platoon was sent to operate as special operations cells, and VC cadres were establishing bases among laborers for future operations.
*   Forty VC guerrillas, aged 14-16, were sent to conduct sabotage and kidnappings of Government of Vietnam (GVN) and U.S. personnel.
*   These reports indicate a significant communist presence and operational capacity within the capital, posing a direct threat to the stability of the region.

## Planning for the Reoccupation of North Vietnam (November 1962)

*   A November 20, 1962, report reveals that Minister for Civic Action Ngo Trong Hieu was directed to assist in planning for the reoccupation of North Vietnam.
*   Assistants were tasked with drafting questionnaires to gather information from selected people in South Vietnam and former residents of North Vietnam about acquaintances still living there.
*   This initiative reflects a desire within the South Vietnamese government to potentially expand the conflict and undermine the communist regime in the North, although the true intentions and feasibility of such plans remain unclear.

## Deteriorating Relations: Nhu's Stance on American Aid (April 1963)

*   An April 20, 1963, telegram reveals Ngo Dinh Nhu's statements on the withdrawal of American aid.
*   Nhu stated that the GVN would revise its policy on receiving aid and should march toward the "ultimate objective" of terminating American assistance, emphasizing self-sufficiency.
*   He outlined priorities for aid: essential means of production, aid that could be phased out, and aid that could be terminated immediately.
*   Nhu also instructed province chiefs to encourage local weapon production to achieve self-sufficiency.
*   This stance indicates a growing resentment towards American influence and a desire for greater autonomy, potentially driven by concerns over U.S. pressure on the GVN.

## Diem's Concerns and Planned Reduction of U.S. Personnel (April 1963)

*   An April 22, 1963, report indicates growing tension between the GVN and the U.S. government over operations in South Vietnam.
*   Diem and Nhu were concerned about "infringements" of Vietnamese sovereignty, particularly by MAAG and U.S. Special Forces.
*   Diem planned to confront Ambassador Nolting and USMACV Chief General Harkins with evidence of U.S. responsibility and demand a reduction in U.S. personnel due to the force being "too large and unmanageable."
*   This reflects a deepening mistrust of U.S. activities and a desire to reassert control over internal affairs.

## Increased Viet Cong Terrorist Activity (April 1963)

*   An April 25, 1963, report details a Viet Cong concentration on terrorist and military subversion activity in the Saigon area.
*   Ward-level officials were informed that terrorist activity would increase, with Americans as primary targets.
*   VC counterpropaganda personnel were instructed to suspend activities and prepare for transfer to military subversion organizations.
*   This escalation of VC activity underscores the growing threat to both Vietnamese and American personnel, further destabilizing the region.

## Coup Plotting by VNQDD (May 1963)

*   An May 18, 1963, telegram discusses plans for a coup d'état in Central Vietnam by the reformed VNQDD (Vietnamese Nationalist Party).
*   The TXPT (Thoat Xac Phong Trao), composed of former VNQDD members, planned to take control of key military units and the Da Nang air base.
*   The plan involved taking Ngo Dinh Can and Archbishop Ngo Dinh Thuc into custody and gaining military control over Thua Thien and Quang Nam provinces.
*   This action would then be followed by a coup against the regime in Saigon.
*   The potential for a separate coup in Central Vietnam, even if uncoordinated, added another layer of complexity to the political landscape and raised concerns about potential fragmentation.

## Apprehensions of Vietnamese Consul General in Singapore (May 1963)

*   An May 18, 1963, report reveals the apprehensions of Vietnamese Consul General Tran Kim Phuong in Singapore regarding recent events in Vietnam.
*   Phuong believed that the dismissal of Huynh Van Lang, the removal of Dr. Tran Kim Tuyen, and the Hue incident on Buddha's birthday might prove fatal to the Diem regime.
*   He feared that Tuyen's dismissal would cause insecurity among loyal supporters and public servants, while the Hue incident would alienate the predominantly Buddhist population.
*   Phuong noted that the regime was destroying confidence and loyalty among public servants, intellectuals, party supporters, and the mass of non-Catholic peasantry.
*   These concerns from a high-ranking Vietnamese official highlight the internal erosion of support for the Diem regime.

## Discussions with Nationalist China (March 1963)

*   A March 19, 1963, telegram details discussions between President Diem and Vice President Chen Cheng of Nationalist China.
*   Chen offered Diem increased military training and technical support, plus up to one division of combat troops to fight in Vietnamese Army uniforms.
*   Chen also asked Diem to cease drafting overseas Chinese in Vietnam and to publicly support the Nationalist China mainland counterattack theme.
*   Other topics included joint operations into North Vietnam and Laos, Thailand's movement towards neutrality, and efforts to unseat Cambodia's Sihanouk.
*   These discussions suggest Diem was exploring alternative sources of support and potentially considering expanding the conflict beyond South Vietnam's borders.

## Seeking American Support for Overthrowing Diem (March 1963)

*   A March 20, 1963, report indicates that representatives of a committee of nationalist anti-communist political oppositionists sought American support for overthrowing the Diem regime.
*   The oppositionists claimed that American aid was essential for a successful coup and that, without it, they would seek other sources of support.
*   They believed that Diem should die suddenly to avoid chaos, and that Ngo Dinh Nhu and his wife must be eliminated.
*   These reports indicate a clear desire among certain elements within South Vietnam to remove Diem from power and a willingness to seek external support to achieve this goal.

## Government White Paper on the Buddhist Issue (June 1963)

*   A June 19, 1963, telegram reports that Madame Ngo Dinh Nhu asked Gene Gregory of the Times of Vietnam to prepare a white paper on the Buddhist issue and American presence in South Vietnam.
*   The paper was intended for international distribution, primarily targeting the United States, France, and England.
*   One of the principal points to be included was a comparison of South Vietnam with the United States, highlighting gangsterism and race riots to suggest the Diem regime was not "too bad after all".
*   This initiative indicates an attempt by the Diem regime to manage international perception and defend its actions amid growing criticism.

## Nhu's Coup D'état Plan (July 1963)

*   A July 12, 1963, CIA Information Telegram details Ngo Dinh Nhu's plan to stage a coup d'état.
*   Nhu proposed to army general officers on July 11, 1963, that they stage a coup d'état as soon as possible.
*   The coup was to be staged overnight, and the army should turn over control to civilians the next day.
*   Nhu stated that the government was making no progress in the war against the Viet Cong or in other programs and that the general officers must provide the action required.
*   He suggested that the army seize "troublemakers," including Buddhist leaders, but later clarified that he only meant the "five ringleaders."
*   This report indicates Nhu's willingness to destabilize the government further to consolidate power and address internal dissent, highlighting the internal power struggles within the regime.

## Status of Coup Plans of Tran Kim Tuyen (July 1963)

*   A July 16, 1963, CIA Information Telegram reports on the status of coup d'état plans of Tran Kim Tuyen's group.
*   An individual associated with the group said that their nationalist, anti-communist coup would occur "soon."
*   However, the coup would not be staged until after the anniversary of the Geneva Accords (July 20), as the Viet Cong were reportedly planning to intensify their activities during the week prior.
*   The coup would be directed against President Diem as well as the Ngo Dinh Nhus, and the group planned to establish a constitutional regime behind Vice President Nguyen Ngoc Tho.
*   This report indicates that multiple factions were planning coups, further destabilizing the political situation and reflecting the deep divisions within the South Vietnamese government.

## Government Foreign Policy in Light of Ambassador Lodge (July 1963)

*   A July 17, 1963, CIA Information Telegram discusses a possible change in the Government of Vietnam's foreign policy in light of the appointment of Ambassador Lodge.
*   By mid-July 1963, President Ngo Dinh Diem was considerably disturbed over the designation of Henry Cabot Lodge, Jr. as Ambassador to the Government of Vietnam (GVN).
*   The appointment suggested to the President that the United States planned to wield a "big stick," and the GVN recalled a number of its diplomats for consultation.
*   The representatives were ostensibly recalled so that they could attend a seminar on the Strategic Hamlet Program, but the GVN actually wanted to discuss its position in regard to the Buddhist situation and to attempt to define a new GVN foreign policy in light of the Lodge appointment.
*   This report suggests that the Diem regime was concerned about the new U.S. Ambassador and was recalibrating its foreign policy in response, potentially seeking to assert greater independence from the United States.

## Comments on the Current Situation (July 1963)

*   A July 18, 1963, CIA Information Telegram discusses Major General Duong Van Minh's comments on the current situation and on the need for a change in the government of Vietnam.
*   On July 16, 1963, Major General Duong Van Minh, military advisor to President Diem, criticized the President, said that he lacked the support of the people, and advocated a change in the regime, but asserted that Ngo Dinh Nhu could not take over the government.
*   Minh stated that Diem had changed so completely that it was no longer possible to reason with him and that Diem was operating under a mandate from heaven.
*   He also stated that the Buddhist problem was far from settled and becoming worse.
*   This report reveals the growing dissatisfaction among high-ranking military officials with Diem's leadership and the increasing desire for a change in government, highlighting the potential for a military-led coup.

## Conclusion

These documents collectively paint a picture of a South Vietnam teetering on the brink of collapse in 1962 and 1963. The Diem regime faced threats from multiple angles: escalating Viet Cong activity, internal dissent within the military and government, growing Buddhist unrest, and deteriorating relations with its primary ally, the United States. The documents reveal a government grappling with how to respond to multiple crises and a series of uncoordinated coup plots. Ngo Dinh Nhu emerges as a key figure, attempting to consolidate power while simultaneously alienating various factions. The increasing American concern and the appointment of Ambassador Lodge signal a potential shift in U.S. policy, adding further uncertainty to an already volatile situation. The implications of these findings suggest that the seeds of future conflict and regime change were already sown, setting the stage for deeper U.S. involvement and the eventual overthrow of Diem.

## JFK Files Explained for a Novice

Okay, imagine you're trying to understand a complicated soap opera, but you only have bits and pieces of the script. These JFK files are a bit like that – secret documents that give us clues about what was happening in Vietnam in the early 1960s, especially around President Diem and his government.

**Here's the gist, simplified:**

*   **Vietnam was split:** North Vietnam was communist, and South Vietnam was *supposedly* a democracy, but it was run by President Diem.
*   **The US was involved:** America was giving money and military help to South Vietnam to stop communism from spreading. This was during the Cold War, remember?
*   **Diem wasn't popular:** People didn't like him for several reasons. He favored Catholics over Buddhists, his government was corrupt, and he seemed out of touch with what ordinary people wanted.
*   **People were plotting against Diem:** Even *within* his own government and military, people were talking about overthrowing him – a coup.
*   **Communists were active:** The Viet Cong (VC) were communist fighters in South Vietnam, trying to topple Diem's government and unite the country under communism.
*   **The US was getting frustrated:** America was pouring money into South Vietnam, but things weren't getting better. Diem seemed stubborn and unwilling to listen to advice. So, the US was getting fed up and considering their options.

**What these documents show:**

*   **Potential coups:** High ranking military officials wanted to overthrow Diem and knew the US would not approve of this "unlawful act".
*   **Communists were everywhere:** The Viet Cong weren't just in the countryside; they had agents operating *inside* Saigon, the capital.
*   **Diem's brother was trouble:** Ngo Dinh Nhu, Diem's brother, was a powerful figure. He was making decisions that were angering people and even planning his own coup.
*   **American aid was resented:** Some people in Diem's government thought the US was trying to control them through aid money. They wanted to be more independent.
*   **Buddhist crisis:** The Buddhist majority felt discriminated against, which led to protests and unrest. This made Diem look bad to the rest of the world.

**Why is this important for JFK assassination research?**

Some people believe that President Kennedy was considering withdrawing support for Diem before he was assassinated. These documents show how unstable the situation was in Vietnam and how much trouble Diem was causing. This could have influenced Kennedy's thinking and, potentially, U.S. policy toward Vietnam.

**In short:**

These JFK files are like puzzle pieces that help us understand the messy situation in Vietnam in the early 1960s. They show a country divided, a leader losing control, and a superpower (the US) struggling to figure out what to do. They are important because they give us insight into decisions that led the United States to deepen its involvement in the Vietnam War.
