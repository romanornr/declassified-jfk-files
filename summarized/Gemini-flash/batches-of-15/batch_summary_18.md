# CIA Operations and Personnel: A Consolidated Summary of Declassified Documents

This summary consolidates information from multiple declassified CIA documents, focusing on covert operations, personnel security, and key individuals involved in sensitive activities. The documents span from 1959 to 1967, providing a glimpse into the Agency's operational methods, security protocols, and the management of its assets and personnel during the Cold War era.

## Establishing Cover Identities and Operational Security

Several documents detail the creation and management of cover identities for CIA personnel. A memorandum dated 24 October 1960, addresses the need to establish "backstopped residence addresses" for an individual named David S. KOPLES in both Washington, D.C., and Los Angeles.

*   **Objective**: To provide plausible explanations for Subject's presence in different locations and activities, particularly related to private business ventures in Phoenix, Arizona.
*   **Washington, D.C. Cover**: KOPLES was to be identified as a recently returned State Department employee who had taken a new position with the Department of the Army. The provided phone number for emergency contact was OX 6-2255, U.S. Army Staff-Group.
*   **Los Angeles Cover**: KOPLES was to be presented as a local representative for a New York City concern named Bartlett and Rogers, conducting economic research on Latin American trade from approximately 1 August 1958 to 14 October 1960.
*   **Physical Description**: For inquiries in Los Angeles, Subject was described as a single individual, approximately 35 years old, 6 feet tall, 200 lbs., swarthy complexion, with dark hair and eyes, earning over $10,000 per year.

These measures aimed to protect KOPLES’ true identity and affiliation with the Agency, underscoring the importance of maintaining operational security in various contexts.

Another document describes the alias documentation for James P. O’Connell in April 1962. It shows:

*   Preparation of alias documentation including but not limited to: a California Driver's License, Social Security card, Reserve Officers Association identity card with the rank of Commander, and an appropriate insurance identity card.
*   Physical description: Eyes - Blue; Hair - Brown; Height - 6'3"; Weight - 200 lbs; Complexion - Ruddy; Birth - 19 February 1917, Elmhurst, New York.
*   Requested to utilize a non-backstopped, multiple unit address in San Francisco.

## Personnel Management and Overseas Deployments

The documents also shed light on personnel management within the CIA, particularly concerning overseas deployments and security briefings.

*   **Morales, David S.** An "Interview Processing Sheet" indicates that Morales was scheduled for overseas travel to Moscow in November 1953.
    *   He received briefings on security regulations, travel precautions (to carry nothing identifying him with CIA), cover story, handling of personal affairs, personal correspondence, and personal conduct.
    *   The debriefing covered SI, Q, and CRYPT.
    *   He had a polygraph in October 1953 and CLC in October 1955.
*   **O'Connell, James P.** A message from April 1963 indicates that clearance status was forwarded through special channels and he was visiting Hong Kong, Singapore, Kuala Lumpur, Bangkok, Saigon, Phnom Penh, and Manila.

These entries highlight the rigorous security protocols and preparations undertaken for CIA personnel engaged in overseas assignments, especially in sensitive locations such as Moscow. They showcase the CIA's focus on ensuring that its personnel were well-prepared and aware of the risks involved in their missions.

A memorandum dated 26 Feb 1965, highlights key assignments within the Office of Security:

*   **Arthur C. Sheridan**: To replace James P. O'Connell, Jr. as Chief, Far East Regional Security Staff in (3-17 Okinawa) during July 1965.
*   **James W. McCord, Jr**: To replace Sheridan as Chief, Technical Division during June 1965.
*   **James P. O'Connell, Jr**: To be assigned as Chief, Investigations Division upon his return in August 1965 and be promoted to GS-16.

## Robert A. Maheu and Covert Operations

Robert A. Maheu, described as a personnel relations executive and former FBI agent, features prominently in several documents. He was utilized by the Office of Security on many sensitive assignments since the early 1950s and had been cleared for use by the DD/P (Deputy Director for Plans) in various capacities.

*   **Senate Subcommittee Interest**: The Senate Subcommittee investigating wiretapping activities (Long Committee) expressed interest in Maheu.
*   **Onassis/Niarchus Feud**: Maheu's involvement in the struggle between Greek industrial giants Stavros Niarchus and Aristotle Onassis is detailed. Maheu was retained as a trouble shooter for Niarchus.
    *   The Agency furnished the communications, courier facilities, and direction in the form of our Commo channel, pouch system, and the NEA Division's expertise and guidance.
*   **Project TWIXT**: Maheu was granted Covert Security Clearance on 16 August 1954 for use on Project TWIXT, involving William Miller, William F. Rowland, George Prussing, Walter Snowden, and Charles Williamson.
*   **King of Jordan**: In 1959, Maheu was granted Covert Security Approval for liaison with U.S. officials for use in the United States and Jordan, employed by the King of Jordan to handle Jordanian public relations in the U.S.
*   **Sukarno Operations**: In 1958-59, Maheu was used by the FE Division in two sensitive operations targeted against Sukarno, approved by Allen Dulles and Joseph Smith.

Maheu's extensive involvement in sensitive operations made the Agency vulnerable to exploitation should he be interrogated in depth regarding his activities. The Agency was concerned about protecting itself from embarrassment or compromise due to his potential testimony before the Long Committee. The memo mentioned that he was maintaining a cooperative attitude.

Maheu contacted his attorney, Edward P. Morgan, of Washington, D.C., who mentioned his close friendship with Senator Long's personal attorney. It was revealed that Bernard Fensterwald, Chief Attorney for the Committee, implied that Maheu was the "ace in the hole" for planned TV hearings.

## Activities and Operations in 1964

A memo from November 1964 details the planned return of several individuals, AAC-1130 through AAC-1148, to the U.S. around November 30, 1964, and later revised to the first week of December 1964.

*   **Personnel**: Santiago ARGUELLES Izquierdo (AAC-1130), Angel Manuel BENITEZ Benitez (AAC-1131), and others.
*   **Arrival**: The individuals (except AAC-1142 and AAC-1143) were scheduled to arrive at Andrews Air Force Base, Md., around midnight on 5 December 1964, on an Agency C-118, tail number 3820.
*   **Accompanying Personnel**: Bob Gambino, Arthur Garza, William Robertson, and Dr. James Fearon, M. D., would also be aboard.

*   **Individuals**: The list includes names such as SACHEZ Raul Gutierrez, LICETI Cruz, Rene, and others.
*   **Purpose**: Likely used for tracking and managing individuals of interest to the CIA, potentially for recruitment, surveillance, or other operational purposes.

## Ed Morgan and His Background

A memorandum from 4 May 1967 provides background information on Edward P. Morgan, an attorney.

*   **FBI Background**: Morgan served in the FBI from 1940 to 1947, lectured at the Training Division, and came to the attention of Director J. Edgar Hoover.
*   **Private Law Practice**: He entered private law practice in Federal Communications, becoming well-known, and his firm name is Welch, Mott & Morgan.
*   **Office of Price Stabilization**: During the Korean War, Morgan headed the investigative and compliance unit of OPS, hiring many Ex-Agents.
*   **Relationship with Hoover**: He reportedly ran afoul of the Bureau by proselyting Bureau Agents at higher salaries and was speculated to replace Hoover.
*   **Society of Former Agents**: Morgan was active in the Society of Former Agents but became bitter after losing the bid for National President in 1957, blaming the Bureau for blacklisting him.
*   **Associates**: He moves in fairly high circles in D.C., belonging to the Touchdown Club and an exclusive country club.

## Technical Advancements and Security Measures

The documents reveal efforts to enhance security measures through technical advancements.

*   **Audio-Countermeasures Program**: James W. McCord, Jr., Alan F. Petit, and William M. Marcy of the Technical Division spent off-duty hours improving the Agency's Audio-Countermeasures Program from December 1965 through May 1966.

## Explanation for Readers Unfamiliar with JFK Files

Okay, imagine you're piecing together a behind-the-scenes look at the CIA during the Cold War. The documents you just read are like snippets from that story, giving you glimpses into how the agency operated, protected its secrets, and managed its people.

**What's the big picture?**

These documents, which were once secret, show the CIA working hard to gather intelligence, protect itself from being spied on, and run covert (secret) operations. They cover everything from creating fake identities to moving people and equipment around the world secretly.

**Think of it like this:**

*   **Fake IDs and Cover Stories:** Imagine a spy movie where the agent has multiple identities. The CIA did that in real life, as demonstrated in these documents. They created false backgrounds and addresses for their people so they could operate without being detected. For example, the document about David S. KOPLES outlines how the CIA created a fake identity for him, making him appear like a State Department employee or a trade representative depending on where he was and who he was talking to.
*   **Secret Missions and Safe Travel:** When CIA agents traveled, especially to places like Moscow during the Cold War, they had to be super careful. The document about Morales shows the detailed briefings they received about security, how to behave, and what to say.
*   **Working with Untrustworthy Individuals:** Sometimes, the CIA had to work with people who weren't exactly saints. Robert A. Maheu is an example. He was involved in some shady stuff, like a fight between two rich Greek businessmen (Onassis and Niarchus). The CIA used him for various operations, but they also knew he could be a liability, especially if he were to spill secrets under pressure.
*   **Moving People and Equipment Secretly:** The document discussing the return of individuals (AAC-1130 through AAC-1148) shows how the CIA moved people and cargo (including weapons!) secretly, using Air Force planes.
*   **Protecting Secrets:** The CIA was constantly working to improve its security. The document about McCord, Petit, and Marcy highlights how they developed new ways to detect hidden microphones, using X-ray technology. They are finding people to train and help the other security team member find any bugs or devices.
*   **"Green List" and Tracking People:** There is a Green List that identifies Cuban Nationals. The list kept track of people who might be helpful or dangerous, potentially for recruitment, surveillance, or other operational reasons. This document shows the CIA keeping tabs on people.

**Why does it matter?**

These documents are important because they give us a rare look into the inner workings of the CIA during a critical time in history. They show the kind of risks the agency took, the lengths they went to, and the ethical dilemmas they faced. Plus, some of these individuals and operations have connections to other historical events, including the JFK assassination, which is why these files are being released in the first place.
