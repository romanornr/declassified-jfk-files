# CIA Operations in Havana and Mexico City: A Summary of Classified Documents

This summary compiles information from a series of classified CIA documents dating from 1960 to 1963, shedding light on covert operations primarily in Havana, Cuba, and Mexico City. The documents detail audio surveillance efforts, personnel deployments, and the complex challenges faced by the CIA in maintaining security and cover during a period of heightened geopolitical tension.

## STESCALADE: Audio Surveillance of the New China News Agency in Havana (1960)

In September 1960, a memorandum addressed to the Director of Central Intelligence (DCI) outlines a clandestine audio operation, code-named "STESCALADE," targeting the New China News Agency (NCNA) office in Havana.

*   **Initial Setup (May-November 1959):** The Havana Station initiated the operation after the NCNA opened an office in the El Medico Building in May 1959. Ambassador Bonsal and Embassy employee Carolyn O. Stacey were consulted. A microphone and tape recorder were installed in Stacey's apartment adjacent to the NCNA office on November 29, 1959, with the assistance of an FE Division case officer and a TSD technician.
*   **Expansion and Relocation (June-August 1960):** By June 1960, there was evidence suggesting additional rooms occupied by NCNA housed communication equipment and were used for conferences. FE Division case officer Bryan Mills explored improving the operation, leasing an apartment directly above the NCNA office. In August 1960, a team of three TSD technicians, already in Havana for a separate SR Division operation, installed additional equipment, including a probe microphone and tape recorder, in the new apartment. The equipment in Stacey's apartment was removed, except for the probe.
*   **Security Measures:** To provide a safe haven, a key to an apartment leased by Embassy secretary Marjorie Lennox was obtained, telling her it was needed for photographic purposes.
*   **Compromise and Apprehension (September 1960):** The operation faced challenges due to building owners canceling sub-leases. A decision was made to install transmitters and switches for remote monitoring. On September 14, 1960, technician David L. Christ (alias Carswell) missed a scheduled appointment. On September 15, Cuban authorities searched Lennox's apartment and took her into custody. Robert Neet, an FE Division case officer, and the stay-behind agent were also detained.
*   **Aftermath:** As of September 20, 1960, the stay-behind agent remained in Cuban custody, while his wife was released. Neet and Lennox were released and debriefed in Washington. The three TSD technicians (Christ, Walter E. Szuminski (alias Taransky), and Thornton J. Anderson (alias Danbrunt)) remained confined.
*   **Cover and Potential Charges:** The Cuban press reported the technicians' arrest, referring to them by their aliases. The sub-lease for the apartment was in the stay-behind agent's name, with the original lease in Mills' name. Initial reports suggested the technicians would be charged with espionage "against the people of China," but later press releases were unclear.
*   **Cover Measures:** The technicians traveled as tourists with light commercial cover. A New York law firm was briefed to handle inquiries to the cover companies. The families of the technicians were informed and supported by the Agency.

## RELEASE CONTINGENCY OPLAN 62-2: Extraction of Detained Personnel

This document outlines a contingency plan, OPLAN 62-2, for the potential extraction of personnel apprehended by Cuban authorities, namely Thornton J. Anderson (alias Danbrunt), Daniel L. Carswell (alias Christ), and Walter E. Szuminski (alias Taransky).

*   **Situation:** The three TSD staff employees were arrested in Cuba in September 1960 and are serving ten-year sentences. Efforts are underway to secure their release. The plan accounts for release at various locations.
*   **Mission:** Det. 1, 1045th Operational Evaluation and Training Group, is tasked with providing black air transportation from the designated site to a secure area.
*   **Execution:** Black air transport will be activated at the request of WH/4, COS Mexico, or Operation Support Headquarters, depending on the release point and urgency. Requests for black transport should include specific details.
*   **Personnel Responsible:** Major Richard I. Skinner, Robert Morrero, Major Billy B. Campbell, and Major Kenneth R. Burton are identified as key personnel responsible for activating and executing the plan.
*   **Standby Capacity:** Det. 3 is to furnish a C-54 aircraft and crew in standby capacity.

## Mexico City Operations: Surveillance, Recruitment, and Information Gathering (1963)

The following documents highlight various CIA activities in Mexico City during December 1963:

*   **Travel and Personnel:**
    *   Miss Norma Valverde's flight was rerouted.
    *   A request was made for commo training for Marta (Valdes) Iernandez Sinele, employed as a statistician in Havana, scheduled to return to Cuba around December 20, 1963.
    *   Jerzy Plebanski was scheduled to attend an international symposium in Dallas, Texas.
    *   Angel Guadalupe Rivera's address in Mexico City was being used as a letter drop for CRYSTAL-1.
*   **Agent Recruitment and Management:**
    *   "BROTHER" indicated that "SUBJ" was willing to remain inside "forseeable future," and the CIA was willing to establish a $200 monthly escrow account.
    *   "SUBJ" had access to plans and activities within the Ministry of Industries.
    *   The subject was frequently consulted by Ernesto "Che" Guevara and sat in on high-level planning sessions at the Ministry.
    *   A request for the current status of LIENVOY-8 was made, including an analysis of his reliability and any security problems.
*   **Information Gathering:**
    *   Information from [ITALINA] and [FRENCH] ambassadors to Cuba, Cuban merchants, and sugar experts was used to assess Cuban government efforts to initiate commercial barter with West European countries.
    *   Information was gathered regarding Soviet technicians leaving Cuba and the presence of Soviet-type tanks in the area.

## ZRPRIMA Program Assessment and Re-evaluation (1963)

A multi-addressed cable outlines the findings of a review of the ZRPRIMA program, designed to recruit Cuban technicians.

*   **Program Failure:** The review indicated that KUBARK efforts had not achieved significant results. The main reason was the failure to recruit the targeted number of technicians from Western Europe.
*   **Reasons for Failure:** The Cuban Foreign Ministry and Foreign Service Officers were reluctant to aggressively pursue tech recruiting. Bureaucratic incompetence in Havana, fear of infiltration, and Castro's loss of interest contributed to the failure.
*   **Recommendations:** An intensive search for ZRPRIMA candidates was deemed no longer worthwhile. However, stations were instructed to remain alert for opportunities to exploit non-Bloc technicians already in Cuba.

## Other Operations and Personnel (1963)

*   Identification of RUPEK DUDIN and ARLETTE FRANCOISE HEZARIFEND.
*   DESIGNET, a former long-term resident, was scheduled to revisit PERUMEN on a business trip for NERIOLO.
*   JOSE LUIS (ZALA)'s residence in Mexico City was identified.
*   ALFREDO DAVINS was identified.
*   A letter to AMSOUR-2 was being pouched to Mexico City for mailing to Sr. Juan Gomez Blanco in PERUMEN.
*   ALFONSO BIBILIOX was identified.

## Conclusion and Implications

These classified documents collectively paint a picture of intense CIA activity in Cuba and Mexico during the early 1960s. The operations included audio surveillance, agent recruitment, and information gathering, all conducted under a veil of secrecy and facing constant threats of exposure.

*   **Challenges and Risks:** The documents highlight the challenges of maintaining cover, the risks of exposure, and the difficulties in recruiting and managing agents in hostile environments. The compromise of the STESCALADE operation in Havana underscores the vulnerability of such clandestine activities.
*   **Operational Adjustments:** The re-evaluation of the ZRPRIMA program reflects the Agency's willingness to adapt strategies based on performance. The shift from intensive recruitment to opportunistic exploitation demonstrates a pragmatic approach to intelligence gathering.
*   **Geopolitical Context:** These operations occurred against the backdrop of the Cold War and the Cuban Revolution. The documents underscore the strategic importance of Cuba as a focal point of espionage and counter-intelligence efforts.

The documents reveal the intricate and often precarious nature of CIA operations during a critical period in history. The successes and failures detailed in these records provide valuable insights into the challenges and complexities of intelligence gathering and covert action.

## Making it Easy to Understand the JFK Files for Beginners

Okay, so you've just read a summary of some old, secret CIA documents. It probably sounds confusing, right? Let's break it down in a way that makes sense, even if you know nothing about the JFK files or spy stuff.

**Imagine this:** The Cold War was a giant chess game between the USA and the Soviet Union (Russia). Cuba, a small island near Florida, became a key pawn when Fidel Castro, a communist, took over. The CIA, America's spy agency, was trying everything to keep an eye on Cuba and stop the spread of communism.

**What were these documents about?**

*   **Listening in Cuba (STESCALADE):** The CIA wanted to know what the Chinese (who were also communist) were saying at their news office in Cuba. So, they set up a sneaky listening device in a nearby apartment. Think of it like bugging someone's house, but on an international scale.  This operation, unfortunately, got busted.

*   **Saving the Spies (RELEASE CONTINGENCY OPLAN 62-2):** Because the spies were caught, the CIA created a secret plan to rescue them if they ever got released from Cuban prison. It was like a Hollywood rescue mission in the works.

*   **Spies in Mexico City:** Mexico City was a hot spot for spies from all sides. The CIA was using Mexico as a base to keep tabs on Cuba and recruit people who could give them information.

*   **The Cuban Tech Idea (ZRPRIMA Program):**  Cuba needed skilled workers. The CIA thought it could sneak its own agents into Cuba by having them pretend to be technicians. This plan failed because the Cubans were too suspicious and disorganized.

**Key takeaways:**

*   **Cold War drama:** These documents show how intense the Cold War was. The CIA was doing all sorts of risky things to gather information and undermine communism.

*   **Spy work is hard:**  Spying isn't like the movies. It's messy, complicated, and things often go wrong. People get caught, plans fail, and it's hard to trust anyone.

*   **Keeping Secrets:**  Everything was top secret. The spies used fake names (aliases), and the CIA went to great lengths to cover their tracks.  That's why the documents are full of code names and strange jargon.

*   **Why does this matter now?** These documents are part of the JFK files because they offer a glimpse into the secret world of the CIA during a time of huge political upheaval. They might contain information about events leading up to the Kennedy assassination, but the connections can be difficult to establish and are often debated.

**Think of it like this:** You're looking at behind-the-scenes notes from a very complicated, high-stakes political game. It's not always clear what's going on, but it gives you a sense of the atmosphere and the players involved. While it is impossible to know what will come out of these files, they are a fascinating glimpse into a tumultuous period.
