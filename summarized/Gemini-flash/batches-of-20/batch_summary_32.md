# The CIA's Covert Operations in Cuba and Personnel Management (1951-1972)

This summary synthesizes classified CIA documents spanning from 1951 to 1972, primarily focusing on covert operations related to Cuba and the management of personnel involved in these activities. The documents reveal intricate details about agent recruitment, propaganda efforts, paramilitary actions, financial transactions, and the challenges faced in maintaining operational security and effectiveness.

## Personnel Management and Floryan Karty

The initial set of documents pertains to personnel actions involving Floryan R. Karty, detailing his reassignment within the CIA.

*   **Reassignment:** Karty was reassigned as an Ops Officer to the Mexico City Station, Branch 3, effective July 15, 1963. This involved a change in organizational designation from DDP WH (Deputy Director for Plans, Western Hemisphere Division) to the Mexico City Station.
*   **Salary Adjustments:** Karty's salary was adjusted in January 1964, reflecting a routine pay change notification based on his grade and step within the General Schedule (GS) system.
*   **Disability Claim:** A notice indicates an official disability claim file associated with Karty, suggesting potential health issues or injuries.
*   **Service Computation:** Karty's service computation date is listed as October 24, 1948, providing a record of his tenure within the agency.

These documents provide insight into the administrative processes related to CIA personnel, including assignments, compensation, and benefits.

## JMWAVE and Covert Operations in Cuba

A significant portion of the documents focuses on JMWAVE, a CIA station involved in covert operations against Cuba. These operations encompassed intelligence gathering, propaganda, and paramilitary activities.

*   **AMMUG/1 Cover Status:** JMWAVE records indicate that AMMUG/1, an agent, held cover status as part of the Inter-University Committee for Political and Social Action from late 1964 through December 1965, earning $600 per month.
*   **Cover Revision:** In January 1966, JMWAVE revised AMMUG/1’s cover to meet tax requirements and provide effective status cover, with employment under SCHEAFFER beginning January 1, with no interim payment.
*   **Credit Checks:** Credit checks were conducted on AMMUG/1, indicating attempts to purchase a house locally, which prompted the inquiries.
*   **Planned Uprising:** In August 1962, intelligence reported a planned uprising by opposition groups in Cuba, including the UNIDAD REVOLUCIONARIA (UR), DIRECTORIO REVOLUCIONARIO ESTUDIANTIL (DRE), and MOVIMIENTO REVOLUCIONARIO DEL PUEBLO (MRP). However, this information was later deemed potentially inaccurate and possibly a deception operation.

## Yuriy Ivanovic Nosenko and Hostile Interrogation

Another critical aspect of the documents involves Yuriy Ivanovic Nosenko, a Soviet defector.

*   **Hostile Interrogation Plans:** The CIA planned to proceed with hostile interrogation to clarify the Nosenko case, believing he was a provocateur.
*   **FBI Agreement:** The FBI generally agreed with the CIA's views, as formulated in a letter to the Director signed by John Edgar Hoover.
*   **Contingency Concerns:** Discussions were held regarding the possibility of Nosenko escaping, committing suicide, or discrediting American officials.
*   **Potential Turn-Back:** The possibility of turning Nosenko back to the Soviets was considered, raising concerns about discouraging future defections.

## Anti-Castro Activities and Cuban Exile Groups

The documents shed light on the CIA's engagement with various anti-Castro groups and Cuban exiles.

*   **United Revolutionary Movement (URM):** In April 1961, Julio Pablo RODRIGUEZ Reyes, a member of URM, provided information on the organization's activities, including its coordination with the Catholic Chaplain at the Cabana Fortress.

*   **Revolutionary Council:** In October 1961, Dr. MIRO Cardona proposed a plan to establish a government on Cuban soil with U.S. support, suggesting a commando raid near Guantanamo.
*   **Propaganda Efforts:** The CIA supported various propaganda efforts, including radio broadcasts, leaflet distribution, and tours by Cuban exile groups throughout the Western Hemisphere.

## Financial Management of AMBUD Cases

A recurring theme is the financial management of AMBUD (presumably a code name for a program related to Cuban émigrés) cases, particularly dependency payments.

*   **Mutual Agreement:** MHMUTUAL has agreed to take over administration of AMBUD benefits.
*   **Payment Method:** It is recommended that the funds for the AMBUD payments continue until July 1968.
*   **Trust Account:** JMWAVE plans to have ANT IKI-1 purchase a cashier's check for Mrs. Molina and pass the balance to the Finance Officer.
*    **Trust Account Termination:** Martha B. Drangelis HQS recommends Manuel (Reyes) Garcia and Angel (Pastrana) Santos trust accounts also be terminated.

## Internal Security and RIS Penetration Attempts

Several documents highlight internal security concerns and attempts by the Soviet intelligence services (RIS) to penetrate U.S. institutions.

*   **Bell Telephone Laboratories:** In July 1963, concerns were raised about apparent RIS interest in Manfred R. Schroeder and Donald E. Thomas of Bell Telephone Laboratories, with potential recruitment attempts during Schroeder's trips to the USSR.
*   **Defensive Briefings:** Defensive briefings were conducted for individuals like Schroeder to counter potential RIS recruitment efforts.
