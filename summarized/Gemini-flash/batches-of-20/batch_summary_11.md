# Declassified CIA Documents: A Summary of Covert Operations and Personnel Management (1947-1965)

This summary consolidates information from a collection of declassified CIA documents spanning from 1947 to 1965. The documents provide insights into the Agency's operational methods, personnel management, and security protocols during the Cold War era. Key themes include the establishment and maintenance of cover identities for agents, the management of personnel with overseas assignments, and the handling of security risks and potential compromises.

## Establishment of Military Cover Backstops

Several documents detail the process of establishing "Military Cover Backstops" for CIA personnel. These backstops were designed to provide a plausible cover story for agents, masking their true affiliation with the Agency.

*   **Purpose:** The primary goal of military cover was to provide agents with a legitimate-sounding background that could be used to explain their activities and movements.
*   **Mechanism:** This involved creating records and documentation that would support the agent's cover identity, such as employment records with the U.S. Army Joint Operations Group.
*   **Implementation:**
    *   Formal requests for cover were submitted using forms like Form 1322.
    *   Records were blocked to protect the agent's true identity (OPMEMO 20-800-11).
    *   Army W-2 forms were issued to further legitimize the cover (HB 20-661-1).
    *   Changes to the cover required submitting Form 1322, and transferring responsibility required Form 1323 (R 240-250).
*   **Examples:**
    *   Documents dated **August 7, 1962**, and **January 9, 1964** show the establishment of military cover backstops for individuals working with the U.S. Army Element, Joint Operations Group (8739).
    *   One document mentions **David P. Christ** in connection with the cover.
*   **Significance:** These backstops were a critical component of maintaining operational security and protecting agents from exposure.

## Live Address Establishment

One document discusses the establishment of a "live address" for **Gladys G. DANBRUNT** in **Cheverly, Maryland** on **May 17, 1961**.

*   **Purpose:** To provide a physical location where communications (cables, letters, telegrams, and phone calls) could be received for the subject without revealing their true identity or location.
*   **Mechanism:** A cooperating household (Dr. Edward A. and Anne B. SALLOCM) was briefed to accept communications on behalf of DANBRUNT.
*   **Implementation:**
    *   The SALLOCM family was instructed on how to respond to inquiries about DANBRUNT, indicating she was residing with them but unavailable.
    *   The local Post Office (Cheverly) was notified to forward mail to the address.
    *   A Western Union telegram was sent to **Eustace DANBRUNT** in **Cuba** (Reclusorio Nacional, Nueva Gerona, Isla de Pinos) on **May 18, 1961**.
*   **Significance:** This operation demonstrates the elaborate measures taken to create believable identities and communication channels for covert operations. The cover story involved the mother of a prisoner of a foreign government.

## Assessment of Cover Potential for Hargrave Secret Service

A memo dated **December 23, 1963**, assesses the cover potential of **Hargrave Secret Service** in **Chicago**.

*   **Findings:**
    *   Local FBI contacts had little information on the company.
    *   **Albert Johnson**, an ex-FBI agent, described **George R. Hargrave** as the sole owner, prone to overcharging clients.
    *   **Richard Cain**, Chief Investigator, Cook County Sheriff's Office, distrusted Hargrave and considered him indiscreet.
*   **Conclusion:** Based on these findings, the memo suggests reconsidering the use of Hargrave Secret Service for cover purposes.
*   **Significance:** This document highlights the importance of thorough vetting of potential cover organizations to ensure their reliability and discretion.

## Operations Familiarization Course #24

Two documents list the attendees of **Operations Familiarization Course #24**.

*   **Details:** The course included CIA personnel from various components and grade levels.
*   **Attendees:** The list includes names like **Thomas J. AFFINITO**, **John A. BANICK**, **Robert L. BUTENHOFF**, and **Mary A. DONALDSON**.
*   **Significance:** These courses were designed to train CIA personnel in essential operational skills and knowledge. The rosters provide a glimpse into the composition and training of the Agency's workforce.

## David Christ Case: Security Concerns and Operational Details

A document dated **August 14, 1961**, details an interview with **Mrs. Christ**, wife of **David Christ**, who was arrested in **Havana, Cuba** on **September 16, 1960**. Christ was the Chief of the Audio Operations Branch, and his assignment in Havana was clandestine and dangerous.

*   **Key Points:**
    *   Mrs. Christ had limited knowledge of her husband's activities in audio surveillance.
    *   She was informed that her husband's branch was responsible for installing microphones and listening devices.
    *   She knew that technicians imprisoned with her husband were not U.S. citizens.
    *   She was told that revealing her husband's operational role could cause significant damage to the U.S. Government and lead to brutal interrogation.
    *   Christ was employed by a "cover" organization called "Vachats Associates" in New York City.
    *   Mrs. Christ was aware of efforts to secure her husband's release, including an offer to exchange medical supplies.
    *   She was not to be told the name of the Washington attorney handling the case or details of present/future operations designed to effect the release of the men.
*   **Significance:** This document illustrates the security protocols and concerns surrounding compromised agents and the efforts to protect sensitive information. It also showcases the complexities of managing family members who may have limited knowledge of an agent's true activities.

## Continued Military Cover for David P. Christ

A document dated **January 9, 1964**, confirms the continuation of the military cover backstop for **David P. Christ**.

*   **Details:** The cover, managed by the Chief Operating Component: ORD, DD/S&T, was ongoing and included issuing Army W-2 forms.
*   **Significance:** This demonstrates the long-term commitment to maintaining cover identities for certain agents, even after they had been compromised.

## Security Review of a Female Agent with JMARC in Cuba

One document reviews the employment history and security concerns related to a female agent.

*   **Employment History**: After employment as a Type A part time employee and a divorce, she requested to be reinstated as a regular staff employee. Her request was approved. During her employment in (Panama) she was under DAC cover. Back in Washington she was assigned to DDP/WH, Support Staff, Logistics Section.
*   **Havana Assignment**: In May 1960, she was certified to the State Department in connection with a ninety day proposed TDY in Havana, Cuba with JMARC. She was transferred from Havana to Guatemala in October 1960.
*   **Security Concerns**: It was alleged that she was having affairs "with the three people" who were "incarcerated in the Cuban jail", with one being **Dave CHRIST**. This was considered a probable contributing factor to the arrests of Agency personnel in Cuba.
*   **Guatemala**: She dated Ronald Stanley DAVIC, an American who was "wanted" by the FBI for car theft and mail fraud.
*   **Significance**: This document illustrates security concerns related to potential compromise and highlights the counterintelligence measures in place.

## Miscellaneous Personnel and Operational Activities

*   A list containing names such as **David Christ**, along with dates suggests a record of key personnel involved in operations.
*   Documents concerning **Lucien CONEIN** detail reassignment and cover arrangements, including a proposed reassignment to **Caracas, Venezuela** under **AID Cover** in **June 1965**. Domestic Cover List Entry or Change forms are shown as well.
*   A document dated **October 2, 1963** discusses the Military Cover Backstop of **Jose L. BOTEL**, and his cover history is shown dating all the way back to **July 1954**.
*   A memo from **December 24, 1959** confirms that the Office of Security would not favorably entertain a request for **R. L. CROZIER's** utilization in a staff capacity due to security considerations.
*   A memo dated **August 5, 1947** requests Personal History Statements for **Myrtle V. QUINE**, **David R. HESY**, **Endolph H. HESY**, and **Helena V. BIMIOTY** for security checks.
*   A document from **April 12, 1963** discusses the transmittal of an ordinary passport in alias for use by **AEAL-1**.
*   Documents from **March 1961** discuss the pro-Castro sentiments of **Court Wood**, son of **Foster Wood**, and his plans to illegally enter **Cuba**.

## JFK Files Explained: A Beginner's Guide

Okay, imagine the CIA during the Cold War like a super-secret spy agency trying to outsmart the Soviet Union and other potential enemies. These documents are like snippets from their internal records, giving us a peek into how they operated.

Here's a simplified breakdown:

*   **Cover Identities (Fake Lives):**  A big part of being a spy is blending in. These documents talk about creating "covers" for agents – essentially fake jobs, backgrounds, and even paperwork to make it look like they were doing something other than spying.  Think of it like an actor playing a role.
    *   **Military Cover:**  One common cover was to make it look like the agents were working for the U.S. Army, even if they weren't.  This gave them a reason to be in certain places and explained their activities.
    *   **"Live Address":**  Sometimes, they'd even set up fake addresses where letters and messages could be sent without revealing the spy's real location.

*   **Security is Key:** The CIA was obsessed with security (for good reason!).  They had strict rules and procedures to make sure their agents weren't caught or giving away secrets.
    *   **Background Checks:** They carefully investigated people before hiring them, and even investigated their families.
    *   **"Compromised" Agents:** If an agent got caught or their cover was blown, it was a huge problem. These documents show how the CIA tried to manage the damage, protect secrets, and even try to get their agents back.
    *   **Vetting Potential "Covers":** They even investigated businesses and organizations *before* using them as fake employers to make sure they were trustworthy.

*   **Training:**  Being a spy requires special skills. The "Operations Familiarization Course" was basically spy school, where new recruits learned the tricks of the trade.

*   **Why are these documents related to the JFK files?** President Kennedy was assassinated in 1963. Over the years, people have come up with conspiracy theories about who was really behind it. Some theories involve the CIA. These declassified documents are part of the release of information related to the assassination, allowing the public to see what the CIA was doing at the time.  While these documents themselves don't *prove* any conspiracy, they offer insight into the Agency's capabilities, methods, and the kinds of operations they were conducting.
