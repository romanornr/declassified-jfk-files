# Covert Activities and Personnel Management within the CIA: A Consolidated Summary

This summary consolidates information from multiple classified CIA documents, revealing aspects of covert operations, personnel management, security protocols, and the use of cover identities and organizations. The documents span from 1950 to 1964, providing a glimpse into the agency's activities during the Cold War era.

## I. Establishment and Use of Cover Identities and Organizations

*   **Request for Official Documentation (May 8, 1963):** A request was made by Vincent J. Heyman, Chief of SAS/Support, for U.S. Army Investigator Credentials and a Civilian Identification Card in the alias of Balmes N. HIDALGO, Jr., also known as Bernard Forman HILLARY. The credentials were to be used generally in the Southeastern part of the United States and possibly in Latin America in pursuit of the mission of SAS, under the direction of the Chief of Station, JMWAVE. The alias was DDS/IOS registered with RI.
*   **Military Cover Backstop (April 5, 1964):** The establishment of a military cover backstop for Balmes N. Hidalgo, Jr., within the Army Element, Joint Operations Group, is documented. This involved blocking records temporarily, ensuring an Army W-2 was issued, and submitting forms for changes affecting the cover.
*   **Alias Documentation (August 15, 1962):** A request to Chief, TSD for alias documentation, including a Virginia driver's license, for Bernard N. Hillary, with a change of residence to Arlington, Virginia. This suggests an effort to create a more credible cover identity for Hillary, utilizing multiple forms of identification and address changes.
*   **Potential REDSKIN Agent Candidates (February 20, 1961, and February 28, 1961):** Documents discuss the proposal for A&E (Assessment and Evaluation) assessment of potential REDSKIN agents using nonofficial cover. The initial suggestion to use TSD's Psychological Assessment Associates was reconsidered, and the Agency decided to use a cleared employment service in Pittsburgh, the EMPLOYMENT SERVICE COMPANY, managed by Margaret A. KEARNEY, as an initial A&E assessment. Two OTR psychologists, Doctors BRADT and MCKEE, would be documented in true name with the firm. Training and assessment of REDSKIN Agents were to be conducted outside the Washington, D. C. area, with training in a safe house in New York and final assessment in Baltimore.

## II. Security Clearances, Travel Briefings, and Personnel Management

*   **Security Approval for State Certification (December 2, 1960):** A request for security approval for State Certification of Balines N. Hidalgo Jr. for a 30-day TOY (Temporary Operational Yard) to San Salvador. Although Hidalgo's file was non-derogatory, he was a former FBI informant, and the State Department appeared reluctant to consider him for integration in 1957.
*   **Integration into the Department of the Army (December 14, 1950):** John F. RITTENHOUSE was integrated into the Department of the Army as of December 13, 1950, and his security clearance was canceled. The subject was to be considered a semi-covert employee.
*   **Removal of CIA Building Passes (December 16, 1958):** Request to remove CIA Building Passes for members and alternate members of the Inter-agency Defector Committee. Noteworthy members include Mrs. Dorothea K. Matlack and Major Earnest E. Livaditis of the Army, and Major Warren B. Reid of the Air Force.

The briefing included security regulations, travel precautions, personal affairs, personal correspondence, personal conduct, association with foreigners, hostile audio surveillance, cover problems, and responsibility abroad. The individual had previous travel in 1955-58 and 1961.
*   **Cross-Reference for Personnel SD Files (August 2, 1960):** This document notes possible or actual relationships among various individuals, including GETHULE L. CULLY DUPFEY, SL. DUFFY, THAI JOSEPH BURKE, STRANT L. BTT, FRANCIS LEO CARROLL, EDWARD C. PENIMORE, FES E. KK LAU, Thomas F. MC COY, and CLIRE LOUTH LUCE.

Sensitive information may have been conveyed to CYFRAIL/1. WOFIRM personnel included Drone Tenley, Dicas Kooh, Laurere, Richard Ria, and Frank Nagy. The dispatch also notes that CYFRAIL/1 was surveilled by a Station surveillance team and visited the Vientiane office of Investment Overseas Service (IDEN A).

*   **Backstopped Residence Addresses (October 24, 1960):** A request for two backstopped residence addresses for David S. KOPLES, one in Washington, D.C., and one in Los Angeles. The Washington address was to identify Koples as a recently returned State Department employee now with the Department of the Army, while the Los Angeles address was to identify him as a local representative for a New York City concern (Bartlett and Rogers) doing economic research for Latin American trade.

The agents were expected to arrive at Andrews Air Force Base on December 5, 1964, aboard an Air Force C-118, with subsequent transfer to Camp Pickett. The plane carried loose cargo, including weapons and equipment. Customs and I&NS were notified of the arrival.

## V. Conclusion and Implications

These documents collectively illustrate the complex web of activities undertaken by the CIA during the Cold War. Key themes include:

*   **Extensive use of Cover Identities:** The creation and maintenance of cover identities were crucial for operational security. This involved generating false documentation, establishing backstories, and coordinating with other agencies.
*   **Thorough Security Protocols:** Security clearances, travel briefings, and the monitoring of personnel were essential for safeguarding classified information and maintaining operational integrity.
*   **Coordination with other Government Agencies:** The CIA collaborated with the Army, Air Force, State Department, Customs, and Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) to execute its operations and maintain cover.
*   **Management of Agents and Assets:** The agency actively recruited, assessed, trained, and managed agents for various covert projects.

The implications of these findings underscore the CIA's commitment to conducting covert operations globally, utilizing a network of personnel and resources to achieve its objectives. The meticulous attention to detail in creating cover identities and enforcing security protocols reflects the high stakes involved in these clandestine activities. The documents provide valuable insights into the operational methods and organizational structure of the CIA during a critical period in history.

## VI. Simplified Explanation for Readers Unfamiliar with the JFK Files

Okay, imagine you're watching a spy movie, and these documents are like behind-the-scenes notes. They show how the CIA was working in the 1950s and 60s, during the Cold War when tensions were high between the US and the Soviet Union. Because the documents are hard to follow I will make it more understandable:

*   **Creating False Identities:** The CIA often needed its agents to operate in secret. These documents show how they did that. For example, they would get fake IDs (like driver's licenses or even military credentials) under different names so that the agent could blend in. One guy, Balmes Hidalgo Jr., was given a fake identity to use in the US and possibly Latin America.
*   **Secret Operations:** These notes also talk about secret projects with code names like "AEROOT" and "CAMBARO." These projects involved things like spying (audio surveillance), taking pictures, and training people. The documents list the people involved and what they did.
*   **Who's Who?** The CIA needed to keep track of its people and make sure they were trustworthy. These documents show how they investigated agents, checked their backgrounds, and made sure they weren't leaking secrets. They also monitored their travel and gave them special briefings on how to stay safe and not give themselves away.
*   **Working with Others:** The CIA didn't work alone. They cooperated with other parts of the government, like the Army, Air Force, and even the agency that handles immigration (INS). This helped them move agents around and keep their operations secret.
*   **The Big Picture:** These documents give us a glimpse into the world of Cold War espionage. The CIA was actively trying to gather information and influence events around the world, and they used a variety of methods to do it, including creating false identities, running secret projects, and working with other government agencies.
