# Summary of CIA Documents Related to the JFK Assassination

This summary consolidates information from several CIA documents released under the President John F. Kennedy Assassination Records Act of 1992. These documents, dated between 1964 and 1996, offer insights into the CIA's activities and investigations following the assassination, focusing on potential connections to Lee Harvey Oswald, the Soviet Union, and other individuals of interest.

## Initial Assessment and Concerns (March 1964)

*   A clipping from the Italian Communist Party weekly *Rinascita* is circulated within the CIA on 26 March 1964.
*   The article, "The Kennedy Murder and the Secret Services of the USA," written by Gianfranco Corsini, an on-and-off US correspondent for the Italian Communist press, references rumors suggesting the Agency itself organized the murder of President Kennedy.
*   This circulation indicates an early awareness within the CIA of conspiracy theories implicating the Agency in the assassination.

## Warren Commission Inquiry and Oswald's Helsinki Trip (June-July 1964)

*   The Warren Commission, tasked with investigating the assassination, seeks information regarding Lee Harvey Oswald's stay in Helsinki, Finland, in October 1959, and his contact with the Soviet Consulate.
*   CIA officers discuss the timeline of Oswald's visit, including:
    *   Travel time from the airport to downtown Helsinki (25 minutes).
    *   Travel time by taxi from downtown Helsinki to the Soviet Consulate (5 minutes).
    *   The Soviet consulate's operating hours on Saturdays in 1959 (possibly closed at 1300 hours local time).
    *   The retention policy of passenger lists at the U.S. Consulate in Helsinki (six months). Mr. Robert Fulton (CIA) was U.S. consular official there at the time.
*   The CIA considers cabling the Helsinki Station to gather additional information not covered by the State Department's inquiry.
*   Lee H. Wigren, C/SR/CI/R, documents these discussions in memoranda for the record dated 1 June 1964.
*   A meeting occurs between a CIA representative and W. David Slawson, a staff member of the President's Commission, on 9 July 1964, to address apparent inconsistencies between information provided by the CIA and the State Department.
*   The discussion centers around the circumstances of the Oswalds' departure from the USSR and whether it was unusual or suspicious. Key questions included:
    *   Whether Soviet authorities normally permit Soviet citizens married to foreign nationals to emigrate to their spouses' homelands.
    *   Whether they permit Soviet citizens to accompany their spouses simultaneously from the USSR.
    *   How long it takes Soviet citizens to obtain exit visas for such purposes.
*   The CIA representative clarifies that their information primarily concerned Soviet citizens accompanying their spouses abroad, while the State Department focused on Soviets emigrating without regard to departure timing. The CIA's data was based on a review of 26 cases, only four of which involved a Soviet wife leaving with her foreign husband.
*   It is acknowledged that none of the cases reviewed involved a defector who married prior to repatriating, highlighting the uniqueness of Oswald's situation.
*   The CIA agrees to provide a statistical breakdown of the cases used to determine the time taken by Soviet authorities to process exit visas.
*   Slawson indicates he will be sending parts of his report dealing with the Soviet intelligence services to the CIA for accuracy checking.

## Investigation of Joachim Joesten (September 1964)

*   An urgent request is made to several CIA stations to conduct a full check on Joachim Joesten, born on 29 July 1907 in Cologne, Germany.
*   Joesten is described as an author of approximately 30 books and numerous newspaper articles, with his post-WWII works being very anti-KUBARK (CIA). His latest title is "Oswald: Assassin or Fall Guy?"
*   He has written under his own name and pseudonyms, including Franz von Nesselrode, H.F. Thiekin, Walter Kell, and Paul Delathuis.
*   Captured Gestapo documents indicate Joesten joined the German Communist Party in May 1932 with membership number 532315.
*   He owned a lending library and spent time in the USSR until 1933, during which his library was managed by his fiancée, Anna Schinsky. His last residence in Germany was Berlin.
*   Joesten fled to France in May 1933, was in Copenhagen in 1936-37 (but was expelled or left due to anti-Danish government writings), and traveled from Denmark to France via Iceland.
*   In 1940, he was in Sweden, married May Nilsson, came to the U.S. via the USSR in 1941, and became a naturalized citizen in 1948.
*   The CIA seeks local services and overt local pre-WWII references on Joesten and his fiancée.
*   There is a request to check the DDC and locate photostats of any documents, as well as to check the address and name of Hess. The possibility of locating the fiancée is also explored.
*   The urgency of the request is emphasized due to the matter being of interest to the Warren Commission.

## Monitoring Soviet Nationals in India (August 1964)

*   A name check and consolidation request is initiated for Roman Fedorovich Dedkov and his wife, Vilasa Nikolayevna Dedkov.
*   Roman Dedkov, born on 28 March 1927 in Ariansk, USSR, and his wife Vilasa Nikolayevna Dedkov, born on 31 December 1930 in Minsk, USSR, applied for entry visas to India sometime prior to April 1962.
*   Dedkov, who was issued Soviet passport number 207461 on 17 September 1960, was scheduled to arrive in New Delhi for two years as an English language teacher at the Soviet Embassy.
*   It is unknown whether Dedkov actually arrived in New Delhi.

## Dissemination of Warren Commission Testimony (December 1964)

*   The CIA disseminates selected excerpts of Warren Commission testimony to various stations and headquarters divisions.
*   The aim is to focus attention on the magnitude of the problem involved in protecting the Chief Executive and to emphasize the CIA's responsibility to support the Secret Service.
*   The excerpts include discussions on Presidential protection, interagency operational cooperation, information acquisition and dissemination, consultation, coordination, and operational interchanges.
*   Fletcher M. Knight is identified as the originator of the dispatch, with Raymond G. Rocca also noted.

## Withholding Warren Commission Documents (1968)

*   Correspondence indicates an effort to withhold Warren Commission document CD-971 from public release.
*   Sir Charles C. F. Spry, Director General of the Australian Security Intelligence Organization (ASIO), recommends against declassification, citing valid points.
*   Richard Helms, Director of Central Intelligence, acknowledges the recommendation and confirms that there is no intention to release CD-971 due to concerns raised by Spry.
*   CD-971 refers to an investigation of anonymous telephone calls to the Canberra Embassy before and after the assassination of President Kennedy.

## Valeriy Vladimirovich Kostikov and Lee Harvey Oswald (1982)

*   In response to an inquiry, the CIA provides information on Valeriy Vladimirovich Kostikov, a KGB officer who served in Mexico City from 1961 to 1971.
*   Kostikov traveled to Mexico, France, Spain, the U.S., and Cuba between 1959 and 1961.
*   In Mexico City, he was described as a translator, vice-consul, and attaché. He attempted to cultivate a U.S. Government employee assigned to the embassy.
*   In September/October 1963, Lee Harvey Oswald approached the Soviet Embassy in Mexico City seeking a visa to return to the USSR. Kostikov handled this request as a consular officer.
*   The CIA states they have no information indicating any relationship between Kostikov and Oswald other than the visa request.
*   Kostikov returned to Mexico City in July 1968 and was involved in following the activities of Central American communist parties and left-wing groups, reportedly providing them with funds and technical guidance.
*   He made an unusual three-week TDY trip to Moscow in July/August 1969 and a four-day trip to Havana in July 1970.
*   Kostikov's tour in Mexico ended unexpectedly in September 1971, possibly due to his association with Lyalin.
*   He was considered an effective and dangerous intelligence officer in Mexico, described as being without morals, education, and manners.
*   Kostikov was arrested in front of a house of prostitution in Mexico City in 1968.
*   He arrived in Beirut in June 1978.
*   While the file indicates Kostikov may have been a member of Department 13 (Executive Action), this could not be confirmed.
*   The British Security Service references a CIA telecheck claiming Kostikov was Lee Harvey Oswald's KGB case officer in Mexico City, and notes the KGB had a defensive interest in Oswald according to Nosenko.
*   The British are seeking information on whether the KGB might be behind recent threats and violence against Western Missions in Beirut.

## Sergyj Czornonoh Allegations (1978)

*   Correspondence from MI-6 in Washington details allegations from Sergyj Czornonoh, who claims to have provided information about Lee Harvey Oswald to the American Vice Consul in Sofia, Bulgaria, in August 1963.
*   Czornonoh alleges that he informed British authorities in London in July 1963 that Oswald was preparing to assassinate President Kennedy.
*   He claims to have told Mr. Blackshire, the American Vice Consul, that Oswald was an assassin and had a weapon.
*   Czornonoh also claims to have reported his information to the Department of State in Washington, D.C., where he alleged that the Director used anesthesia gas to drug him.
*   Czornonoh's letters include allegations of harassment by the FBI and Secret Service, as well as claims of being drugged and used in political assassination attempts.
*   Czornonoh's credibility is questionable due to the inclusion of bizarre allegations and apparent mental instability.

## KGB Official Nikonov's Review of Oswald Files (1991)

*   During the week of 3-9 November 1991, a U.S. professor discussed the KGB with "Slava" Nikonov, Deputy to KGB Director Bakatin.
*   Nikonov, grandson of former Soviet Foreign Minister Vyacheslav Molotov, reviewed five thick volumes of KGB files on Lee Harvey Oswald in preparation for establishing KGB-CIA liaison.
*   Nikonov concluded that Oswald was at no time an agent controlled by the KGB, noting the KGB watched him closely while he was in the USSR.
*   The files reflected Oswald had a stormy relationship with his Soviet wife and was a poor shot when he tried target firing in the USSR.

## Potential Release of Classified Document (1996)

*   A fax received by a CIA station appears incomplete, containing a cover sheet, a one-page Copenhagen cable stating "no traces," and the first page of a Director cable requesting traces on Lee Harvey Oswald.
*   The station indicates it cannot make a case against the release of the material unless the missing portions have some bearing on Denmark.
*   It is insisted that crypts be deleted from the document before release.
*   The station requests to be apprised of the release date to inform the Ambassador and liaison service chiefs.

## 201 System Documentation (1974)

*   The 201 system is detailed as a method for identifying persons of specific interest to the Operations Directorate and for controlling and filing all pertinent information about them.
*   It involves assigning a unique number to each individual (201 Number) and creating a 201 Dossier containing biographic reporting.
*   The Master 201 Record is a machine record generated by opening a 201 file, and the Main Index Master 201 Reference is printed in response to an Index Search Request.
*   OI Codes (Organization of Interest) are two-letter symbols used to record an individual's association with organizations or activities of operational interest.
*   The opening of a 201 dossier is the prerogative of an operational component, coordinated with the Information Services Group.
*   Information about a 201 personality should be filed or cross-referenced into his dossier, including biographic information, photographs, fingerprints, operational approvals, and name check replies.
*   Purging a 201 dossier is the responsibility of the desk officer, requiring discrimination in recognizing operationally useful material.
*   Access to a sensitive 201 dossier may be restricted by holding the file at the desk or placing it on restriction in Central Files.
*   Machine listings provide field stations and Headquarters desks with names and 201 numbers in the requester's particular geographic or functional area of interest.

## Australian Checks Regarding Possible Soviet Involvement (December 1963)

*   Preliminary checks of recorded conversations are conducted in response to requests for information potentially linking the Soviet Union to the JFK assassination.
*   Checks include information on a dark blue Buick, license plate variants, possible involvement of individuals, and physical descriptions of Soviet personnel.
*   A liaison officer is engaged to trace any further calls made, and the embassy is in contact with Square representatives.

## Conclusion

These documents paint a picture of a CIA grappling with the aftermath of the JFK assassination, both in terms of investigating potential leads and managing the public perception of the Agency's role. The documents highlight several key areas of focus:

*   **Oswald's Connections:** The investigation into Oswald's activities in the USSR and Mexico, particularly his interactions with Soviet officials like Valeriy Kostikov, aimed to determine if there was any Soviet involvement in the assassination. The conflicting reports about Kostikov's role and Oswald's KGB connections underscore the complexity and uncertainty of these inquiries.
*   **Conspiracy Theories:** The Agency was aware of and concerned about conspiracy theories implicating it in the assassination, as evidenced by the circulation of the Italian Communist Party article.
*   **Information Control:** The efforts to withhold Warren Commission documents and manage the release of information demonstrate a concern about protecting sensitive intelligence sources and methods.
*   **Internal Processes:** The documentation of the 201 system provides insights into how the CIA tracked and managed information on individuals of interest.

The documents underscore the wide-ranging efforts to investigate potential links to the assassination, manage sensitive information, and address public perception in the wake of this pivotal event. They also offer a glimpse into the internal workings and concerns of the CIA during this period.

## Explanation for Someone Unfamiliar with the JFK Files

Okay, imagine the CIA is a giant library of secrets, and the JFK assassination is like a huge, unsolved mystery that everyone is trying to figure out. These documents are like a collection of notes and reports from that library, all related to this one big mystery.

Basically, after President Kennedy was killed, the government wanted to know everything about the shooter, Lee Harvey Oswald. They wanted to know if he had any help, especially from the Soviet Union (which was a big enemy of the US back then).

These documents show the CIA doing a bunch of things:

*   **Looking into Oswald's past:** They were trying to figure out if Oswald had any connections to the Soviets, especially when he lived in Russia for a few years. They looked into a trip he took to Helsinki and any meetings he might have had with Soviet officials.
*   **Checking out other people:** They were investigating people who knew Oswald or might have had something to do with the assassination. One of these people was a writer named Joachim Joesten, who was critical of the CIA.
*   **Dealing with rumors and theories:** They were aware that some people thought the CIA itself was involved in the assassination, and they were trying to figure out how to respond to these rumors.
*   **Hiding some information:** The CIA was also trying to keep some documents secret, because they didn't want to reveal sensitive information about how they operate.
*   **Tracking People:** The 201 system was how they would track people that they were interested in. They would assign them a number and follow them, taking notes along the way.

One of the important people in these documents is Valeriy Kostikov, a Soviet agent who worked in Mexico City. Oswald went to the Soviet embassy in Mexico City a few weeks before the assassination, trying to get a visa to go back to Russia. The CIA was trying to figure out if Kostikov and Oswald knew each other, and if Kostikov had anything to do with the assassination.

Another interesting person is Sergyj Czornonoh, who made some pretty wild claims about knowing Oswald and warning people about the assassination before it happened. But Czornonoh also seemed a bit unstable, so it's hard to know if his claims were true.

Later on, after the Soviet Union collapsed, a former KGB official named Nikonov looked at the KGB's files on Oswald. He said that Oswald was never a KGB agent, but they had watched him closely when he lived in Russia.

So, these documents are like pieces of a puzzle. They show the CIA trying to investigate the JFK assassination, looking for any clues about who was behind it and what their motives were. They also show the CIA trying to manage the information that was coming out and protect their own secrets.
