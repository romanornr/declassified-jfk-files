# CIA Covert Operations and Personnel: A Summary of Key Documents

This summary compiles information from a series of classified CIA documents pertaining to various covert operations, personnel, and security measures. The documents span from 1958 to 1980 and cover a range of activities, including establishing and canceling military cover for agents, facilitating travel under false pretenses, assessing potential recruits, and monitoring individuals of interest. The documents highlight the intricate processes and considerations involved in maintaining secrecy and operational effectiveness during the Cold War era.

## Establishing and Canceling Military Cover

Several documents detail the establishment and subsequent cancellation of "military cover backstops" for CIA personnel. These backstops aimed to provide a plausible explanation for an individual's activities, making it appear as though they were affiliated with the U.S. Army.

*   **Notification of Establishment of Military Cover Backstop (Date: 169709)**: This document outlines the initial establishment of a military cover for an unidentified individual. It includes instructions to block specific records, ascertain the issuance of an Army W-2 form, and submit necessary forms for any changes or transfers of cover responsibility.

*   **Notification of Cancellation of Military Cover Backstop (Date: 11 June 1963)**: This document concerns the cancellation of the military cover for Joseph S. Piccolo, a measure taken after a Form 1322, dated 4 June 1963, removed his cover. The cancellation necessitates unblocking records and returning all military documentation. Mr. White is noted as the point of contact for this action.

*   **Memorandum for Chief, Records and Services Division (Date: 28 September 1961)**: This memo addresses Joseph S. Piccolo's cover debriefing as he resigns on 4 October 1961. It confirms his prior use of nominal state cover in Mexico (1 November 1957 to 14 January 1960) and nominal Department of the Army cover at Headquarters (15 January 1961 to resignation). Piccolo was instructed to identify his employer as CIA and to be vague about his travels, especially his Mexico assignment.

*   **Notification of Establishment of Official Cover Backstop (Date: 15 August 1961)**: This document establishes an official cover backstop for Joseph E. Piccolo, under the U.S. Army Records Analysis Group, referencing Form 1922 dated 28 June 1961. All information is available in Military Cover, CCG, and the CCG must be notified when the cover is no longer required.

## Travel Processing and Security Measures

Another set of documents focuses on the processing and security measures associated with agent travel, particularly to sensitive locations like Mexico City.

*   **Travel Processing Sheet (Date: 6/12/59)**: This sheet pertains to "Teddik Piccilly," a Mast/liff GS-5, scheduled to depart for Mexico City on 14 January 1959. The review of the subject's file includes polygraph results (5 Feb 57), security file checks, and special briefings covering security regulations, travel precautions, cover story adequacy, and personal conduct.

## Potential Recruitment and Assessment

These documents highlight the careful consideration and assessment process involved in recruiting potential assets.

*   **Response to Green List Request (Date: 30 Jan 61)**: This form pertains to Santiago Alvarez Fernandez, born on 12 June 1921 in Havana, Cuba, residing in Miami, Florida. The request seeks derogatory information, indicating an interest in him for espionage or CE (Counterintelligence Evaluation) activity.

*   **Request for Approval or Investigative Action (Date: 30 Jan 63)**: This document requests operational approval for Santiago ALVAREZ Fernandes for use as PM Trainees in Cuba. The document notes his PRO and Green List status, indicating prior records and traces.

*   **Memorandum for the Record (Date: 22 October 1964)**: This memo details an interview with Irving Amron, a candidate for a Russian language linguist position. The memo delves into Amron's extensive background, including his family's history, time spent in the Soviet Union, military service in the Soviet Army, and subsequent return to the United States.

*   **Memorandum of Contact (Date: 16 May 1963)**: This memo describes contacts with Jose Antonio CASAS Rodriguez regarding the Cuban situation. Casas Rodriguez provides information on Cuban government officials, including Eusebio AZCUE, Enrique RODRIGUEZ Loeches, Orlando BLANCO, Faure CHOMON Mediavilla, and Floreal CHOMON Mediavilla. The memo suggests potential operational approaches and assesses the individuals' susceptibility to recruitment.

*   **Memorandum re: Former Contacts Viviana Itakon":** This memo assesses former contacts, including Adolfo SAN FELAYO, Ramon USATEGUI Lezara, Bernard L. Barker (AMCLATTER-1), and Manolo VEGA Abril, offering detailed insights into their personalities, skills, and potential value to the Agency.

## Monitoring Individuals of Interest

The documents also include instances of monitoring individuals potentially linked to hostile intelligence services.

*   **Memorandum for Chief, OSD/OS (Date: August 1964)**: This memo concerns Vladimir RODRIGUEZ Lahera, a WHD asset residing in a safehouse. It requests verification of a phone call made by Rodriguez to a cousin in New York and attempts to identify the subscriber to the New York number.

*   **Memorandum for the Director (Date: 12 February 1959)**: This memo relays information from the Dutch Internal Security Service (BVD) regarding Mollie BLOCK and Morris BLOCK, who traveled to Moscow with falsified passports and expressed a desire to defect to the Soviet Union. Morris BLOCK was previously the subject of File No 201-194231.

## Key Personnel and Locations

The documents reference several key personnel and locations involved in these covert operations:

*   **Personnel:** Joseph S. Piccolo, Santiago Alvarez Fernandez, Irving Amron, Jose Antonio CASAS Rodriguez, Adolfo SAN FELAYO, Ramon USATEGUI Lezara, Bernard L. Barker (AMCLATTER-1), Manolo VEGA Abril, Vladimir RODRIGUEZ Lahera, Mollie BLOCK, Morris Block
*   **Locations:** Mexico City, Madrid, Moscow, Cuba, Miami, Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, Amsterdam

## Security Considerations

Throughout the documents, security considerations are paramount. Measures include establishing cover identities, controlling information flow, monitoring communications, and assessing the reliability and potential risks associated with individuals.

*   **Memorandum for Deputy Director of Security (Date: 12 June 1967)**: This memorandum seeks information on Peter J. DiGervino for an assignment to Madrid, Spain. It requests advice on whether he has been declared to foreign governments or if any security factors should be considered.

## Conclusion

These documents provide a glimpse into the CIA's complex world of covert operations, intelligence gathering, and personnel management during the Cold War. They underscore the importance of maintaining secrecy, assessing potential risks and opportunities, and adapting to evolving geopolitical landscapes. The documents highlight the meticulous planning, careful execution, and constant vigilance required to protect national security interests in a highly contested global environment. The use of cover identities, security protocols, and detailed background checks underscores the operational challenges and the ever-present need to safeguard sensitive information and personnel.

## Plain English Explanation for Someone Who Doesn't Know About the JFK Files

Okay, imagine these documents are like puzzle pieces, and when you put them together, they tell a story about how the CIA was working behind the scenes during the Cold War era. Remember, this was a time when the United States and the Soviet Union were constantly spying on each other and trying to gain an advantage.

These files show the CIA doing a few important things:

*   **Creating fake identities:** The CIA would create fake stories, or "covers," for their agents so that no one would know they were actually working for the CIA. Some agents were given "military covers" to make it look like they were in the Army.
*   **Sending people on secret trips:** The CIA needed to send people to other countries to gather information or carry out secret missions. These documents show them planning those trips, making sure the agents had the right paperwork, and briefing them on how to stay safe and keep their true identities hidden.
*   **Finding people to work for them:** The CIA was always looking for new people to help them. These documents show them looking at potential recruits, checking their backgrounds, and trying to figure out if they could be trusted. They would also get information on people in foreign governments to see if they might be willing to cooperate with the U.S.
*   **Keeping an eye on suspicious people:** The CIA also kept track of people who they thought might be spies or working against the U.S. These documents show them monitoring phone calls and gathering information about these individuals.
*   **Keeping things secret:** All of this had to be done in secret, so the documents show the CIA using code names, tracking who knew what, and making sure that sensitive information didn't fall into the wrong hands.

Essentially, these files reveal the nuts and bolts of how the CIA operated in a world where secrets and deception were the tools of the trade. It's like getting a peek behind the curtain to see how the spy game was really played.
