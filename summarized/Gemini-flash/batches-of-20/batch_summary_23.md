# The CIA's Covert Operations Against Cuba: A Focus on Key Individuals and Tactics (1958-1970)

This summary compiles several classified CIA documents to provide a cohesive narrative of the agency's covert operations against Cuba from 1958 to 1970. It highlights key individuals, organizations, tactics, and operational challenges during this period.

## Early Involvement and Support for Anti-Castro Elements (1958-1961)

The earliest document, dated **December 16, 1958**, shows the CIA tracking the movements of **Ernesto "Che" Guevara** and his forces in Las Villas province. The agency noted Guevara's objective of cutting off the central highway traffic west of Santa Clara.
*   Key findings include confirmation of rebel strategy to disrupt transportation and communication lines and seizing of labor officials within the sugar industries.
*   Simultaneously, **Manuel Ray**, head of the **Movimiento Revolucionario Cubano (MRC)**, was reported to be in the Sierra Maestra, conferring with **Fidel Castro** about a potential merger of the MRC into Castro's **26th of July Movement**, which eventually dissolved the MRC.
*   The document also indicates that **Batista**, then-President of Cuba, contracted French army officers to advise the Cuban army on guerrilla warfare.
*  The **Luis Alberto de Jesus Condom Cajisal** statement from **March 1961**, details his involvement in the anti-communist underground and his interactions with individuals linked to the CIA, including **Bobby Maduro** and **Juan Mendez**. The group worked out of the Edificio FOCSA and gathered information on strategic targets and radio reception in different provinces for utilization of plastic explosives.

## Intensified Efforts: AMBANG-1 and JURE (1961-1963)

The documents reveal a significant focus on supporting and directing Cuban exile groups, particularly the **Junta Revolucionaria Cubana (JURE)**, led by **AMBANG-1** (real name not explicitly stated, but later identified as Rogelio Rodriguez Lopez.)

### Manolo Ray

*   **October 24, 1961**: A message details statements by **Manolo Ray**, likely referring to the earlier mentioned **Manuel Ray** of the MRC. Ray's activities and statements are being monitored by British intelligence and shared with the CIA.
*   **June 1963**: CIA is actively managing contacts with Manolo Ray.

### AMBANG-1

*   **August 19, 1962**: Difficulties in obtaining Mexican visas for AMBANG-1 due to bureaucratic delays and concerns about Cuban exiles becoming public charges in Mexico. The document mentions "LITEMPO," a visa channel, and the need for high-level Mexican contacts to facilitate visa approvals.
*   **August 2, 1963**: Details a meeting with AMBANG-1 in Miami where he requests high explosives (20 pounds and 6-8 thermite grenades) for a sabotage operation against the Havana power plant. He also sought contact with his brother in Guantanamo to inform him about JURE's plans for resistance.
*   AMBANG-1 outlined his political plans, including establishing a base in Santo Domingo and seeking acquiescence from President Juan Bosch for operations against Cuba. He also planned trips to Caracas to orient JURE representation and discuss matters with Venezuelan government officials.
*   He expressed concern over the suspension of PAA flights, which had been crucial for maintaining contact with his network inside Cuba.
*   AMBANG-1 was planning to phase out of his current employment to dedicate himself full-time to the "liberation of Cuba" and requested assistance in establishing a San Juan-Caracas-Miami radio link for JURE communications.
*   AMBANG-1 had received training in a simple scorch system (a method of secret writing) and was writing an article for "Cuadernos," a publication by German Arcienegas, about Latin American problems and their solutions.
*  He believed it would take 2-3 years to destroy the Castro regime, believing that there would be a favorable turn in the Cuban economy by late 1965.

### Tactical and Logistical Support

*   **January 3, 1964**: Memorandum discusses radio switch equipment for demolition firing purposes. It recommends Motorola and Kell as reliable equipment sources and outlines the challenges of ensuring operational reliability due to unpredictable environmental factors.
*  It also mentions inexpensive equipment of Japanese or American manufacture that is available and the Quick Reaction Facility can produce a small number of radio switches based on these devices with a considerably lesser degree of security from false signal triggering with a lead time of 6 to 8 weeks.

## Counterintelligence and Internal Concerns

*   **April 2, 1964**: An individual, posing as an "engineering consultant," attempts to gather information about Manolo Ray's training efforts in Costa Rica. The individual claims to be a friend of Ray and knowledgeable about Central American affairs, raising suspicions about their true affiliation and intentions.
*   **May 18, 1961**: A coded message is prepared for transmission to AMPRE-1 warning him to be careful of ELVIKA JOVANE DE SAYAS, who is suspected of being pro-Castro. The message instructs AMPRE-1 and others to leave Cuba using any means available and outlines alternative communication strategies.
*  An important note is that Roberto is willing to be an alternate WT channel for PETE and NET and provide him with a radio to be used only in an emergency. Felipe should use SW and couriers for normal commo and WT only for very urgent matters and full details of bank account should be sent to Henry's PO Box in Miami.
*   **May 9, 1961**: CARACAS relays a message from AMIRE-1 (Henry) stating that CLINTON, his wife, and EUGENIO have been released and are resuming operations. They have contacts with the TIGER, PACHANA, and Italian ambassadors, who are active in counter-revolutionary efforts. A request is made for more post office boxes.

## Conclusion

The documents paint a picture of sustained and multifaceted CIA involvement in covert operations against Cuba. From tracking key figures like Che Guevara in the early stages of the revolution to supporting and directing Cuban exile groups like JURE, the agency employed a range of tactics, including:
*   **Providing material support:** Supplying explosives, communications equipment, and financial assistance.
*   **Gathering intelligence:** Monitoring the activities of Cuban officials, diplomats, and suspected pro-Castro individuals.
*   **Facilitating logistical support:** Assisting with travel arrangements and establishing communication channels.
*   **Engaging in psychological operations:** Using propaganda and disinformation to undermine the Castro regime.

The focus on individuals like Rogelio Rodriguez Lopez highlights the CIA's efforts to penetrate and disrupt Cuban intelligence operations. The challenges and operational difficulties documented in these reports underscore the complexities and risks inherent in these covert activities. The ultimate goal of these operations was to destabilize the Castro regime and create conditions for its overthrow, reflecting the United States' unwavering opposition to the communist government in Cuba.

## Simplified Explanation for Readers Unfamiliar with JFK Files

Imagine the Cold War is at its peak, and Cuba has just turned communist right next door to the United States. The CIA is tasked with stopping the spread of communism, and Cuba becomes a major target. These documents are like snapshots from that secret war.

**Here's what they show:**

*   **Early Days:** In the beginning, the CIA is trying to understand what's happening in Cuba. They are tracking important leaders, like Che Guevara, and watching how the Cuban revolution is changing things.
*   **Supporting Cuban Exiles:** The CIA starts working with Cuban people who fled the country after Castro took power. These Cuban exiles want to overthrow Castro and take back their country. The CIA provides them with money, weapons, and training to carry out secret missions inside Cuba. AMBANG-1 is a big player from that effort, but he was DGI (Cuban Intelligence) officer.
*   **Espionage and Sabotage:** The documents talk about plans to blow up power plants, disrupt communications, and gather intelligence. The CIA wants to make life difficult for Castro and weaken his government.
*   **Watching Cuban Diplomats:** The CIA keeps a close eye on Cuban diplomats around the world. They suspect some of them are spies and use diplomatic missions to gather intelligence and support communist activities.
*   **Secret Communications:** Because they couldn't just call each other, the CIA and its agents used secret codes, hidden messages, and other sneaky ways to communicate without being detected.
*   **Challenges and Risks:** These missions were dangerous, and the documents show that the CIA faced many problems. They had to worry about double agents, being caught by Cuban intelligence, and dealing with unreliable allies.

**In simple terms:**

The CIA was heavily involved in a secret war against Cuba, trying to undermine Castro's government and support those who wanted to overthrow him. These documents give us a glimpse into the plans, people, and problems involved in that covert operation. It was a complex and dangerous game, with the future of Cuba ‚Äì and US-Cuban relations ‚Äì hanging in the balance.
