# CIA Operations and Investigations: A Summary of Classified Documents

This summary consolidates information from a series of classified CIA documents, dated primarily from 1962 to 1964, relating to various operations and investigations across Europe, Latin America, and the United States. The documents touch on themes of personnel movements, recruitment efforts, counterintelligence, and responses to potential threats.

## Personnel and Operational Movements (April 1964)

Two classified messages from April 17, 1964, outline the movement of CIA personnel and the nature of their assignments.

*   **AMWHIP:** This individual, whose assignment is designated "PARUMEN," is delayed in leaving New York and will likely not be available in Geneva (GNVA) until April 30. AMWHIP has a three-day "KUBARK business" in Paris.
*   **AMWHIP/2:** Rome is requested to have AMWHIP/2 available for assistance before AMWHIP's arrival in Geneva.
*   **Paris Assignment:** Subsequent communications are planned to address AMWHIP's arrival and role in Paris, specifically concerning matters related to "CARRILLO and ROBRENO."
*   **Identification:** Another message identifies CARLOS (TEPEDINO) GONZALEZ, providing a detailed physical description, including his age, height, weight, and distinctive features.

## Investigation of Jack Rubenstein (December 1963)

A communication dated December 2, 1963, references an inquiry (RJ 2995) about Jack Rubenstein, potentially related to the assassination of John F. Kennedy.

*   **Israel Visit:** The document confirms that a Jack Rubenstein, born in Poland in 1905 and a resident of New York, visited Israel from May 17 to June 7, 1962, accompanied by his wife, Mimi.

## ZRPRIMA Program Evaluation (November 1963)

A multi-addressed cable dated November 22, 1963, evaluates the ZRPRIMA program, designed to recruit Cuban technicians in Western Europe.

*   **Program Failure:** The review concludes that the program has not achieved significant results and its continuation is no longer warranted.
*   **Recruiting Shortfall:** The primary reason for the failure is the inability to recruit the targeted number of technicians. Out of an objective of 2000 technicians from Western Europe, fewer than fifty candidates received contract approval, and only about ten actually made it to Cuba.
*   **Reasons for Failure:**
    *   Reluctance of the Cuban Foreign Ministry and Foreign Service officers to aggressively pursue the recruiting mission.
    *   Bureaucratic incompetence in Havana.
    *   Fear of infiltration by hostile agents.
    *   Possible loss of interest in the program by Fidel Castro himself.
*   **Recommendations:**
    *   Discontinue intensive searches for ZRPRIMA candidates.
    *   Stations with active leads should continue their efforts, but new leads should not be generated from scratch.
    *   Stations should remain alert for opportunities to place resident agents in Cuba, exploiting non-Bloc technicians on a limited, selective basis.
*   **Local Communist Party Influence:** Cuban officials responsible for recruiting technicians heavily rely on local Communist Party approval or other indications that a candidate is politically acceptable.
*   **Positive Station Response:** The response of most stations in implementing ZRPRIMA was gratifying, providing Cuban officials with qualified engineers and technicians whom they were unable or unwilling to accept.
*   **Conclusion:** KUBARK (CIA) made a respectable effort to exploit the opportunity, but the lack of significant results reflects Cuban confusion and ineptitude.
*   **Discontinuation:** The ZRPRIMA slug and code 200-120-47 are discontinued.

## Counterintelligence and Agent Identification (1963)

Several documents detail efforts to identify individuals and monitor potential threats.

*   **RUPEK DUDIM:** Identified as 201-83827, along with an alias, FRANCOISE HEZARIFEND BARLATTE, also known as CARTIER, born on March 2, 1936, in Paris, France.
*   **DE POND CALVIN:** Subject E RAKEBRAND, identified as subject A, cooperated with IF émigré channels, ODENVY, and KUBARK in an investigation dating back to 1960. Subject is currently studying Spanish and plans to develop his work as a journalist. His mistress is identified as subject B. No contact between ODENVY and MEXI is to occur.
*   **ARH & Company and Overseas Realty Survey Associates:** Identified as entities related to LILINK. ARH & Company is located at 420 Lexington Ave. in New York, and Overseas Realty Survey Associates is in Seattle, Washington.
*   **Alfredo Davins:** Identified as AMLONG.
*   **Giulio Mondello:** Born on February 26, 1917, in Italy, is an Italian citizen and former agent in Cuba for FIAT. He is also identified as IDEN A. IDEN B is NEBIOLO (LINOTYPE) firm, Turin.
*   **Jose Luis (ZALA):** Located at Ultimas Novedades S.A., 37-219, Mexico City, is likely identical to JOSE LUIS (ZALA), 201-350050, with the same address, currently registered with an answering service.
*   **Joseph Montllor, John E Barber, and Goodwin Shapiro:** Listed as IDEN A, IDEN B, and IDEN C, respectively.

## Cuban Sabotage and Maritime Operations (October 1963)

A classified message from October 1963 discusses a planned sabotage operation against Cuban shipping.

*   **Castro's Allegation:** Fidel Castro claimed that Cuban security forces discovered an attempted sabotage of the Cuban merchant ship "Las Villas." He alleged that the CIA placed a defective bomb on the vessel in Ganda, Italy.
*   **CIA Response:** KUBARK policy is to issue "no comment" unless specifically asked.
*   **Hurricane Flora Impact:** Damage from Hurricane Flora in Cuba is expected to result in a heavy concentration of food and medicine in maritime cargoes to Cuba.
*   **Sabotage Operation Suspension:** Due to the altered percentages and psychological impact, there is a moratorium on sabotage operations against Cuban shipping.
*   **Guidance:** Further guidance will be provided as soon as possible, with changes in approach to make certain.

## LCHARVEST Operation and Liaison Efforts (October 1963)

Documents from October 1963 detail aspects of the LCHARVEST operation, focusing on individuals and liaison efforts.

*   **Liang Szu-Cheng:** Born in 1901, with various educational and professional affiliations, including Tsinghua University, Yale, and involvement in architectural societies in China and internationally. Following criticism in 1957, Liang downplayed his past anxieties.
*   **STPLATE 1:** Arriving in Mexico City on October 12 via Eastern Air Lines Flight 305, carrying identification, and instructed to contact a marine guard at the embassy if contact is missed.
*   **Richard Walker:** Chairman of the Department of International Relations at the University of South Carolina.

## Other Operations and Contacts

*   **PERUNEN Operation:** Involves potential development of Ernesto Abreu Gomez for PERUMEN operations.
*   **Brazilian Elections:** Details regarding funds provided to ARI CAMPISTA, president of the Guanabara Chemical Workers Federation, for use in December elections.
*   **DEVISTA-1 Contacts:** Instructions on providing contacts to DEVISTA-1 in El Salvador.

## Conclusion

These classified documents provide a glimpse into the multifaceted operations of the CIA during the early 1960s. They reveal efforts to monitor and influence events in Cuba and Latin America through technical recruitment (ZRPRIMA), potential sabotage operations, and support for democratic elements. Simultaneously, the documents highlight counterintelligence efforts aimed at identifying and tracking individuals of interest, from suspected agents to potential threats. The range of operations underscores the agency's global reach and its involvement in political and economic activities across various countries during the Cold War. The documents also illuminate the challenges and failures faced by the CIA, such as the underperforming ZRPRIMA program. The level of detail, from physical descriptions of individuals to the internal communications about operational adjustments, offers a comprehensive picture of the intelligence landscape during a critical period in history.

## Simple explanation for a reader who has never read the JFK files

Imagine these documents as pieces of a complex puzzle, all related to the CIA's activities in the early 1960s. During the Cold War, the CIA was very active around the world, trying to gather information, influence events, and counter the Soviet Union and its allies, like Cuba.

Here's what the documents generally show:

*   **Moving People Around:** Some documents talk about CIA agents traveling to different countries in Europe for various assignments. It's like planning a business trip, but for secret agents.
*   **Looking into People:** One document mentions a Jack Rubenstein who visited Israel. This is interesting because, around the same time, Jack Ruby (whose real name was also Rubenstein) killed Lee Harvey Oswald, the man accused of assassinating President Kennedy. So, the CIA was checking out if this was the same person.
*   **Trying to Recruit Experts:** One program, called ZRPRIMA, was about getting Cuban technicians from Europe to work for the Cuban government. The CIA wanted to use this as an opportunity to gather intelligence and potentially place their own agents. But, it didn't work out very well because the Cuban government wasn't very cooperative and didn't recruit many people.
*   **Identifying Potential Threats:** The CIA was also trying to identify and keep track of people who might be a threat or useful to them. This includes agents, political figures, and even ordinary people.
*   **Planning Secret Operations:** Some documents hint at plans to disrupt Cuban shipping, possibly by sabotage. However, a hurricane disrupted these plans.
*   **Working with Others:** The CIA was working with other organizations and individuals to gather information and carry out its missions. This includes universities and even marine guards at embassies.

In short, these documents give us a peek into the CIA's secret world during a tense time in history. They were trying to gather information, influence events, and protect American interests, sometimes with success and sometimes with failure. They were always watching and checking to make sure nobody was going against America.
