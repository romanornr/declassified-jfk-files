# Shadows of Doubt: US Involvement and Internal Conflicts in South Vietnam (1963)

This summary consolidates several classified CIA documents from June to December 1963, shedding light on the complex political landscape of South Vietnam, American involvement, and the growing internal dissent against the Diem regime. These documents reveal a narrative of coup plotting, diplomatic tensions, and the ever-present shadow of communist influence, all leading up to the eventual overthrow of President Ngo Dinh Diem.

## Madame Nhu's Propaganda and the Buddhist Crisis (June 1963)

*   **Document Date:** June 19, 1963
*   **Key Players:** Madame Ngo Dinh Nhu, Gene Gregory

The initial document highlights the government's attempt to manage its image amidst the escalating Buddhist crisis. Madame Nhu, the influential sister-in-law of President Diem, commissioned a "white paper" to be distributed internationally. This document aimed to:

*   Present the Government of Vietnam (GVN) position on the Buddhist issue.
*   Address the broader issue of American presence and policy in South Vietnam.
*   Draw comparisons between South Vietnam and the United States, downplaying the Diem regime's shortcomings by pointing to "gangsterism and race riots" in America.

The white paper, prepared by Gene Gregory of the *Times of Vietnam*, was intended for distribution in the United States, France, and England, indicating a targeted effort to influence Western public opinion.

## Seeds of Discontent: Coup Plotting and US Awareness (July 1963)

*   **Document Dates:** July 12, 16, 17, 18, 1963
*   **Key Players:** Ngo Dinh Nhu, General Officers, Tran Kim Tuyen, Henry Cabot Lodge

These documents detail the emerging coup plots against the Diem regime and the increasing awareness of these plans within the US government.

*   Ngo Dinh Nhu proposed a staged coup to Army General Officers on July 11, 1963. Nhu stated the coup should be quick, overnight, and the government should be turned over to civilians the next day. Nhu wanted the military to seize "trouble makers". Nhu believed that the arrival of a new US ambassador would bring about change and wanted the army to act fast.
*   Dr. Tran Kim Tuyen, an advisor at the Presidency, also led a coup group aiming to establish a constitutional regime behind Vice President Nguyen Ngoc Tho. The group postponed the coup because the Viet Cong were reportedly planning to intensify their activities during the week prior to the anniversary of the Geneva Accords (July 20).
*   President Diem was disturbed over the designation of Henry Cabot Lodge, Jr. as Ambassador to the GVN. The GVN recalled a number of its diplomats so that they could attend a seminar on the Strategic Hamlet Program. However, the GVN actually wanted to discuss its position in regard to the Buddhist situation and to attempt to define a new GVN foreign policy in the light of the Lodge appointment.
*   Major General Duong Van Minh, Military Advisor to President Diem, criticized President Diem, stating Diem lacked the support of the people and advocated for a change in the regime. Minh asserted Ngo Dinh Nhu could not take over the government.

The GVN agents would then burn the Chancery.
*   Cabinet officers recommended to President Diem that Ngo Dinh Nhu be appointed Prime Minister.

## US Guidelines for a Coup (October 30, 1963)

*   **Document Date:** October 30, 1963
*   **Key Players:** Ambassador Lodge, McGeorge Bundy

This document is a crucial policy directive from the White House to Ambassador Lodge, outlining the US position on the potential coup. Key points included:

*   The US would reject appeals for direct intervention from either side.

A VC radio message, in plain text, addressed to the VC SAIGON/CHOLON ZONE COMMITTEE instructed all VC military units to be prepared for an uprising at midnight on August 1. ARVN units have been alerted in the Saigon area.

## Concerns Over British Ambassador and Neutral Solution (August 1962)

*   **Document Date:** August 14, 1962
*   **Key Players:** South Vietnam

The British ambassador to South Vietnam, H.A.F. Hohler, believed that the only solution for South Vietnam was a neutralist coalition. He said that Americans are not trained in Guerilla warfare and can not win the war. The American Ambassador did not believe the view that the British Ambassador had toward South Vietnam.

## Conclusion

These documents paint a picture of a US administration caught between its commitment to South Vietnam and its growing unease with the Diem regime. The internal political turmoil, fueled by the Buddhist crisis and coup plotting, created a volatile environment that ultimately led to the US tacitly supporting Diem's overthrow. The aftermath of Kennedy's assassination added another layer of uncertainty, as the new administration grappled with how to navigate the complex situation in Southeast Asia. The conflicting views among US officials, as well as those of allies like Great Britain, highlight the lack of consensus on the best path forward. The ultimate consequence was the tragic assassination of President Diem and his brother Nhu, further destabilizing South Vietnam and deepening American involvement in the Vietnam War.
