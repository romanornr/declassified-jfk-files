# CIA's Covert Operations: Cuban Revolution, Vietnam, and Beyond

This summary consolidates classified CIA documents spanning from 1952 to 1968, revealing covert operations during the Cuban Revolution, the Vietnam War, and related international activities. The documents highlight the use of informants, double agents, propaganda, and complex coordination efforts with other U.S. agencies and foreign entities.

## I. Monitoring Cuban Counterrevolutionaries (1962-1965)

These documents detail the CIA's efforts to monitor and manage Cuban counterrevolutionary groups in the United States following the Cuban Revolution.

- **Alpha-66:** In August 1962, the CIAâ€™s New York office established contact with Robert A. Prachett, a U.S. citizen with extensive experience in Cuba. Prachett was tasked with providing information on Alpha-66, a Cuban counterrevolutionary group planning sabotage operations in Cuba. The goal was to control, encourage, or discourage these activities based on U.S. interests. Prachett reported that Alpha-66's plans included blowing up all the power plants in Cuba.
- **Cuban Refugee Groups:** The Minneapolis office was in contact with George Hauer, who provided names of leaders within a Cuban refugee group shuttling between the U.S. and Cuba. This group sought assistance in the form of supplies and was establishing reception groups in Cuba, smuggling medical supplies, ammunition, and weapons into Cuba, and extracting Cubans wishing to leave.
    - Key figures:
        - Ernesto Rodrigues y Moreno: Owner of a Cities Service Station in Marathon Shores, Florida.

Lam A was involved in intelligence or related activities in Laos since 1949. He had been deported to a German concentration camp during the war. Lam A participated in the Atlantic Operation (AO), using the work as a means to make money to fund propaganda and buy off the opposition. He was also an old friend of Col. Jean Gardeneral, former chief of UNIS at Da Lat.

## III. Coordination and Control of Anti-Castro Activities (1962)

    - **Third Country Diplomats:** ACSI expressed interest in using third-country diplomatic channels (Spanish, Uruguayan, and Canadian) to establish communications with assets inside Cuba, but the CIA denied the use of these facilities due to security concerns.
    - **Maritime Infiltration:** Discussions centered on the possibility of the CIA infiltrating ACSI agents into Cuba, but the CIA refused to infiltrate any agents into Havana.

## IV. Propaganda and Information Dissemination (1965)

This document outlines the CIA's use of propaganda through the Information Council of the Americas (INCA).

- **Information Council of the Americas (INCA):** In May 1965, the CIA's New Orleans office identified INCA as a source of foreign intelligence on the radio broadcasting industry in Latin America. INCA disseminated anti-Communist material ("Truth Tapes") to radio stations in Latin America and North America. The CIA worked with Edward Scannell Butler, Executive Vice President and Staff Director, to gather information on the reach and impact of the program. The CIA suggested questions for INCA's questionnaires to elicit technical information about the stations and their equipment.

## V. Intelligence on Maurice Halperin (1962)

This document focuses on gathering information about the activities and whereabouts of Maurice Halperin.

- **Maurice Halperin:** In December 1962, a source informed the CIA that Halperin had sent a Christmas card with a return address in Havana, Cuba. Halperin was described as someone who "always seems to show up wherever there is some sort of activity going on."

## VI. Operation AMFAUNA: An Intelligence Network in Cuba (1962)

These documents describe the recruitment, operation, and management of an intelligence network inside Cuba.

- **AMFAUNA-1:** The central figure in this operation was a Cuban national recruited and trained by the CIA. He legally returned to Cuba in March 1961 and established a network of over twenty sub-agents. He sent back 140 S/W (secret writing) messages, leading to over fifty intelligence disseminations. AMFAUNA-1 was described as skilled in security practices and used a false identity ("Julio ROJO") to protect his operations.
- **Network Structure:** AMFAUNA-1 used a system of cutouts (AMFAUNA-2, AMFAUNA-3, AMFAUNA-4, AMBOA-1, and AMFAUNA-5) to maintain contact with his sub-agents and ensure compartmentation.
- **Sub-agents:** The network included a diverse group of individuals providing various types of intelligence:
    - AMFAUNA-23: AMFAUNA-1's sister-in-law, served as a contact to members of his net in asylum.
    - AMFAUNA-3: Provided information on military hospitals and had a contact in the G-2 (Cuban intelligence).
    - AMFAUNA-4: A high-ranking Cuban Army officer providing documentary information.
    - AMBOA-1: A contact of Cubana Airlines Pilots
- **Communications:** AMFAUNA-1 primarily communicated through S/W, using accommodation addresses serviced by AMPAN-2 and AMCUTLER-1. He also used diplomatic couriers (Spanish and Argentine Embassies) to send documents and materials.
- **Finances:** The operation cost $500 per month, distributed through a system involving contacts in the U.S. and Cuba.

## VII. International Institute for Peace (1961)

These documents detail the CIA's use of cover stories and backstopping to protect agents and their operations.

- **Case 9145 (William J. Acon):** In January 1952, the CIA sought to create a cover story for William J. Acon, who was resigning from the ECA (Economic Cooperation Administration) to work for the CIA. The Research Institute of America (RIA) was asked to backstop Acon's resignation by ostensibly hiring him. Leo Cherne, Executive Secretary of RIA, agreed to cooperate. Acon's background was in economic research on Italy, making RIA a logical choice for the cover.

## IX. Peace Demonstrations (1967)

This document pertains to the monitoring of peace demonstrations and related organizations.

- **Catholic Association for International Peace (CAIP):** In October 1967, the CIA collected literature mailed by the CAIP to its members concerning "Negotiation Now!" and its 40th Annual Conference, themed "Selective Conscientious Objection in an Age of Conflict." This information was gathered by Oliver H. Corbuston, who had joined the CAIP for cover purposes.

## X. Project PAFLIPPER: Infiltration of THERIAULT (1955)

These documents concern the operational aspects of a project involving THERIAULT and her activities in India.

- **THERIAULT:** In May 1955, THERIAULT was debriefed following a trip to India. Discussions included her expenses, areas of influence, and potential interest in Krishna Menon. The CIA sought to develop an interest in Krishna Menon, utilizing a cleared publisher who could request Menon to write a book, and extending an official invitation to visit the U.S. THERIAULT was to be informed that her reports have been of immeasurable assistance to the Ambassador and to the U.S. Government vis-a-vis policy planning for India.

## XI. Pursuit of Martin Luther King Jr.'s Suspected Assassin (1968)

These documents detail the CIA's efforts to identify and locate the suspected assassin of Martin Luther King Jr.

- **Eric Starvo Galt/James Earl Ray:** In April 1968, the CIA disseminated information provided by LNERGO concerning the suspected assassin, initially identified as Eric Starvo Galt (aliases Harvey Lowmyer, John Willard). The message included physical characteristics and a request for every effort to determine if Galt had been in their area.

## XII. Ongoing Operations and Contact Reports (1960-1967)

These documents highlight the ongoing nature of CIA operations and the importance of maintaining contact with assets.

- **LITAMIL-901:** Documents from May 1963 report on the activities of LITAMIL-901, an agent in Mexico, and his contacts with Cuban officials and other individuals of interest.

## Conclusion

These documents paint a picture of the CIA's extensive involvement in covert operations during a tumultuous period. From monitoring Cuban counterrevolutionaries and supporting anti-Castro activities to gathering intelligence during the Vietnam War and tracking suspected assassins, the CIA utilized a range of tactics and resources to pursue U.S. interests. These efforts involved complex coordination with other agencies, the cultivation of informants, and the strategic use of propaganda. The operations reveal the lengths to which the CIA went to gather information, influence events, and protect its assets in a world shaped by Cold War tensions and ideological conflicts.

## JFK Files for Beginners

Okay, imagine the CIA during the Cold War is like a super-secret detective agency trying to protect America from the Soviet Union and its allies (like Cuba). These files are like pieces of evidence from some of their most important cases.

**What are these cases about?**

*   **Cuba:** The CIA was obsessed with Cuba after Fidel Castro took over. They were worried about Cuba becoming a base for communism so close to the U.S. These files show the CIA:
    *   **Spying on anti-Castro groups:** Even the Cubans *against* Castro were watched carefully. The CIA wanted to make sure *they* weren't a problem.
    *   **Planting spies in Cuba:** They recruited Cubans to send back secret information.
    *   **Using propaganda:** They tried to influence public opinion against Castro.

*   **Vietnam:** This was another place where America was fighting communism. These files show the CIA gathering information and trying to understand what was going on.

*   **Important People:** These files mention names like Maurice Halperin or James Earl Ray. The CIA was tracking people who they thought were important or dangerous for different reasons.

**How did the CIA do all this?**

*   **Informants:** They paid or convinced people to give them secret information.

*   **Cover stories:** Agents pretended to be someone else to hide what they were really doing.

*   **Secret Codes:** They used codes to send secret messages.

**What's the big picture?**

These files give a glimpse into the hidden world of the CIA during a time of great fear and uncertainty. They show how the CIA was constantly working to protect America, sometimes in ways that were very secretive and even controversial. They help us understand *how* the CIA was operating at a period in history that shaped the world.
