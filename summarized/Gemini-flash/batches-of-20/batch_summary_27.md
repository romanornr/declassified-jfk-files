# The AMMUG/1 Project: CIA Activities in Cuba and Latin America (1964-1973)

This summary outlines CIA activities, primarily in Mexico and Latin America, between 1964 and 1973. It focuses on intelligence gathering, surveillance operations, and efforts to counter Cuban influence in the region. The documents reveal the use of assets, safe houses, and technical resources to monitor embassies, individuals, and political movements. A central figure in these operations is referred to as "AMMUG/1," whose expertise and potential impact are regularly assessed.

## Safehouse Establishment and Utilization (May 1964)

*   **Safehouse Designation:** On 14 May 1964, a safehouse was established at HUNTING TOWERS, MT. VERNON BLVD., APT. #731-WEST, ALEXANDRIA for immediate use by AMMUG-1.
*   **Assessment and Inventory:** The apartment was deemed adequate after a viewing. An inventory of household equipment was scheduled for 19 May 1964, with AMMUG-1 planned to move in shortly thereafter.
*   **Coordination:** Mr. (Ray Scofield) coordinated these activities, advising Mr. (John Ryan) of the Safehouse Branch that no further inquiries for apartments in the N.W. section of Washington were needed.

## Identity Document Procurement for Mexico City (May 1964)

*   **Document Preparation:** In May 1964, preparations were underway to create identity documents for use in Mexico City. KURIOT was tasked with preparing a driver's license and voter registration.
*   **Driver's License Requirements:** The driver's license required a full-face negative, alias name and signature specimen, and the asset's date of birth for mail recovery purposes.
*   **Voter Registration:** For the voter registration, the occupation "empleado" (employee) was deemed sufficient.
*   **Delivery:** The documents were to be forwarded via air mail ASAP to Travelers Advisory Service in Washington, D.C.

## Potential Use of AMMUG-1 in Montevideo (November 1964)

*   **Montevideo Presentation:** In November 1964, a plan was considered to have AMMUG-1 visit Montevideo for a presentation similar to one requested in Santiago.
*   **Impact Evaluation:** An evaluation of AMMUG-1’s potential impact, both as a person and the timeliness of his information, was requested for a presentation before the Minister of Interior and Chief of AVALANCHE.
*   **Objective:** The briefing aimed to convince the need for support for the newly created Directorate of Intelligence Unit.

## Recruitment Operations in San Salvador (1967)

*   **Objective:** Attempts were made to recruit individuals trained by the DGI (Cuban Intelligence) by leveraging AMMUG-1's presence in San Salvador.
*   **Arrest and Interrogation:** JUSLOOP-1 ordered the arrest of José Rehberto Carrillo Calderon for interrogation and potential recruitment.
*   **Recruitment of Alejandro Gonez Montano:** Attempts were made to recruit Alejandro Gonez Montano. His imminent release from jail complicated efforts to detain him long enough for a recruitment pitch.

## Cuban Intelligence Directives in Haiti and the Dominican Republic (1963-1965)

*   **Source:** A former Cuban intelligence officer provided documents detailing policy guidance for Cuban intelligence representatives.
*   **Haiti Focus:** Cuban intelligence in Haiti focused on plans of aggression against Cuba, progressive political forces, and strategic information. Priorities included monitoring counterrevolutionary operations, the Haitian armed forces, and the Communist Party of Haiti.
*   **Dominican Republic Focus:** In the Dominican Republic, Cuban intelligence prioritized collective action against Cuba, leftist forces, and the Dominican Republic Armed Forces. They also monitored training camps, counterrevolutionary organizations, and the CIA in Santo Domingo.

## AMMUG/1 Identification Efforts (August 1965)

*   **Query for Information:** In August 1965, AMMUG/1 was queried for any information on Manuel ESTEVEZ Perez but was unable to identify the name.
*   **Photograph Request:** It was suggested that a photograph of ESTEVEZ Perez be shown to AMMUG/1 for possible identification.

## KDFACTOR Project: Surveillance in Mexico City (1972-1973)

*   **Purpose:** The KDFACTOR project was a visual and photographic surveillance operation in Mexico City, primarily targeting the Soviet Embassy.
*   **Basehouses:** The project utilized two basehouses, KDLITERAL and KDABSINTHE, to monitor personnel and vehicles entering the Soviet Embassy.
*   **Termination:** The KDFACTOR project was terminated due to a security compromise. The VWBLANKET principal knew details of the operations.
*   **Personnel:** The project involved multiple salaried assets who provided photographic coverage and visual observations.
*   **Financials:** The project budget included salaries, rent, utilities, and operational expenses. Termination costs for the assets exceeded initial estimates.

## LIENVOY Project: Intercepting Communications (1959-1963)

*   **Purpose:** The LIENVOY project involved intercepting communications, primarily targeting Cuban, Soviet, and Yugoslav embassies in Mexico City.
*   **Information Gathering:** The project gathered transcripts and intelligence leads through monitoring telephone lines and other communications.
*   **Personnel:** The project involved translators, technicians, and liaison personnel.
*   **Coordination:** The project was coordinated with Mexican officials and involved technical support from CIA personnel.

## Concerns and Mitigation Strategies
* **Limited Eldg Should be Razes Rather than Repaired:** Headquarters agrees in principle that the Elgd should be razed.
* **Commercial Income-Getting Venture:** Should not do this unless there are overriding security and ops considerations
* **Building to be constructed with KUBARK Funds:** Blueprints for any building to be constructed with KUBARK Funds must receive EDOS approval.
* **Estimated Fees for Total Approval:** Estimated fees for Total Approval after receipt plans hopefully two months.

## Conclusion

These documents paint a picture of extensive CIA operations in Latin America, particularly focused on countering Cuban and Soviet influence. The AMMUG/1 project, along with surveillance operations like KDFACTOR and LIENVOY, highlights the agency's efforts to gather intelligence, monitor key individuals and organizations, and maintain a presence in the region. The termination of KDFACTOR due to security concerns underscores the risks and challenges inherent in these clandestine activities, and the effort to procure a safehouse underscores the need for a safehouse. The policy guidance directives for Cuba show the detailed focus Cuban intelligence placed on countries such as Haiti and the Dominican Republic.
# Explanation for a Reader Unfamiliar with JFK Files
Let's break down these CIA documents so they make sense, even if you've never heard of the JFK files before.

**What are the JFK Files?**

After President John F. Kennedy's assassination, there were many questions and conspiracy theories. In 1992, the US government passed a law to release classified documents related to the assassination, to provide more transparency. These are known as the JFK Files, though they often contain information about a lot more than just the assassination itself.

**What's the Big Picture Here?**

The documents we're looking at are from the 1960s and early 1970s, during the Cold War. The United States and the Soviet Union (including Cuba) were in a global struggle for influence. The CIA was very active in Latin America, trying to prevent the spread of communism and keep countries aligned with the US.

**Key Themes and People**

*   **Countering Cuba:** A major focus is monitoring and countering Cuba's influence in Latin America. Cuba had become a communist state under Fidel Castro, and the US worried about other countries following suit.
*   **Surveillance:** The CIA was heavily involved in gathering intelligence through surveillance. This included monitoring embassies (like the Soviet and Cuban embassies), intercepting communications (phone calls, etc.), and tracking individuals.
*   **Assets and Agents:** The CIA used "assets" (people who provided information or services) and "agents" (people working secretly for the CIA) to gather intelligence and carry out operations.
*   **AMMUG/1:** This is a code name for a person of interest. The CIA was clearly interested in their knowledge and potential use in various operations, and would be considered a great asset.
*   **Mexico City:** Mexico City was a hub for CIA activity in Latin America, likely due to its location and the presence of embassies from various countries.

**Specific Operations**

*   **LIENVOY:** This project involved tapping phone lines to intercept communications from Cuban, Soviet, and Yugoslav embassies. The CIA monitored these communications for intelligence leads.
*   **KDFACTOR:** This was a photographic surveillance operation focused on the Soviet Embassy in Mexico City. The CIA used safe houses to watch the embassy and take pictures of people and vehicles entering and leaving.

**Why is This Important?**

These documents show the extent of CIA involvement in Latin America during the Cold War. The CIA was:

*   **Actively spying:** Using various methods to gather intelligence.
*   **Working to counter communism:** Trying to prevent the spread of communist influence.
*   **Using resources:** Spending money and personnel to carry out these operations.

The release of these documents helps to shed light on a controversial period in history and the methods used by the CIA to achieve its goals.

**Things to Note**

*   **Code Names:** The documents use code names to protect the identities of people and operations. This can make it difficult to understand exactly what was going on, but it's a standard practice in intelligence work.
*   **Classification:** The documents were originally classified, meaning they were kept secret to protect national security. The fact that they are now public allows us to learn more about this history.
*   **Bias:** It's important to remember that these documents are from the CIA's perspective. They may not present a complete or unbiased view of events.
