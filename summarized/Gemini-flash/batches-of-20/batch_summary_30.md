# Operation AMLASH: A CIA Chronicle of Cuban Intelligence and Subversion (1963-1980)

This summary compiles classified CIA documents spanning from 1963 to 1980, focusing on Operation AMLASH, a complex and multifaceted effort to gather intelligence on Cuba, recruit assets within the Cuban government and military, and potentially destabilize the Castro regime. These documents reveal the intricate operational activities, key personnel, security concerns, and the evolving strategies employed by the CIA during this period.

## I. Early Recruitment and Operational Setup (1963-1964)

### A. Key Players and Initial Contacts

- **AMLASH/1:** A primary Cuban asset, later identified as Rolando Cubela Secades, a radical post and separatist department commander at Fajardo Hospital in Havana. He is a crucial figure in the intelligence gathering and recruitment efforts.
- **AMWHIP:** A friend of AMLASH/1 who is instrumental in arranging contacts and serving as a potential conduit for communication.
- **ANTRUNK:** Refers to a series of operational plans involving infiltration and exfiltration of agents to and from Cuba, focusing on intelligence gathering and recruitment.
- **AMICE-14:** A team leader involved in the ANTRUNK operations, responsible for contacting and recruiting agents, particularly AMTRUNK-10.
- **AMTRUNK-10:** An internal principal agent within Cuba, targeted for recruitment to spot and recruit high-level figures dissatisfied with the Castro regime.

### B. Establishing Communication Channels

- **S/W (Secret Writing):** A key method for clandestine communication between agents, involving special materials, codes, and secure addresses.
- **OWVL (One-Way Voice Link):** A method where AMICE-14 would leave a receiver with AMTRUNK-10 for communication.
- **Secure Channels:** Utilizing various cut-outs and intermediaries to relay information between AMLASH/1 and the CIA, including individuals in Paris, Madrid, and New York.

### C. Key Findings

- AMLASH/1 was considered a valuable asset, positioned to provide intelligence on the Cuban government and military.
- The CIA established a network of safe houses, training areas, and personnel to support the ANTRUNK operations.
- Security was a major concern, with efforts to vet and train agents, develop cover stories, and establish emergency communication protocols.

## II. Expansion and Evolution of Operations (1964-1965)

### A. Refining Intelligence Gathering

- Focus shifted towards recruiting additional assets within the Cuban Intelligence Service (DGI), particularly those who could be assigned to foreign locations like Caracas, Venezuela.
- Efforts were made to gather information on specific Cuban officials, their relationships, and their potential vulnerabilities.
- Requirements included gathering intelligence on Cuban military capabilities, economic conditions, and political developments.

### B. Adjustments to Operational Tactics

- The ANTRUNK operations continued, with adjustments made to infiltration and exfiltration methods based on environmental conditions and security concerns.
- Experiments were conducted with modified sights and ammunition for the 7.62 Belgium (FAL) rifle to improve performance in low-light conditions and with silenced weapons.

### C. Communication and Security Issues

- Concerns arose regarding the security of certain communication channels, particularly after an agent was compromised ("UNSNAFU/9 fired").
- Efforts were made to determine the extent of the security breach and to mitigate any potential damage to AMLASH/1 and other assets.
- The use of open letters and coded messages was employed, but recognized as less secure than dedicated S/W channels.

### D. Key Findings

- The CIA adapted its operational tactics based on experience and changing circumstances in Cuba.
- Security remained a paramount concern, with ongoing efforts to protect assets and communication channels.
- AMLASH/1 continued to provide valuable intelligence, but the operation faced challenges in maintaining secure communications and recruiting new assets.

## III. Ongoing Operations and Asset Management (1965-1980)

### A. Managing AMLASH/1 and Related Assets

- The CIA sought to determine the nature of an agent's accusation that another agent was a "dirty KUBARK agent" and if the accusation posed a risk to AMLASH/1.
- Personnel changes and assignments, such as the assignment of Joseph Langosch to brief Presland in Rome, indicate the ongoing management and coordination of the operation.
- There was a need to balance the value of AMLASH/1 as an intelligence asset with the inherent risks of operating in a hostile environment.

### B. Later Developments (1970-1971)

- Focus shifted to Eloy Gutierrez Menoyo, a former head of the Second Front Escambray (SNFE), who was captured and imprisoned in Cuba.
- Efforts were made to establish communication channels with Gutierrez Menoyo through intermediaries in Miami and Madrid.
- Information was sought on individuals connected to Gutierrez Menoyo, including Pedro M. Diaz, to assess their potential value as assets or sources of information.

### C. Key Findings

- The AMLASH operation evolved over time, with a focus on managing existing assets, recruiting new agents, and adapting to changing circumstances in Cuba.
- Security concerns and communication challenges remained persistent throughout the operation.
- The CIA continued to seek intelligence on key Cuban figures and events, with the ultimate goal of undermining the Castro regime.

## IV. Conclusion and Implications

The documents paint a picture of a complex and sustained CIA effort to gather intelligence on Cuba and destabilize the Castro regime. Operation AMLASH involved recruiting assets within the Cuban government and military, establishing clandestine communication channels, and conducting infiltration and exfiltration operations. The documents highlight the challenges of operating in a hostile environment, including security concerns, communication difficulties, and the need to adapt to changing circumstances. The operation's focus on AMLASH/1 as a key asset demonstrates the importance of human intelligence in the Cold War struggle against Cuba. Despite the challenges, the CIA remained committed to its objectives, seeking to gather intelligence, recruit agents, and ultimately undermine the Castro regime.

## V. Making the Summary Understandable for Readers Unfamiliar with JFK Files

Understanding classified CIA documents requires some context, as they often contain coded language, acronyms, and references to events and people that are not immediately obvious. This summary aims to make these documents accessible to a broader audience by explaining the key elements and providing a simplified narrative.

**What is Operation AMLASH?**

Imagine a Cold War spy drama set in Cuba. Operation AMLASH was a real-life version of that. It was a secret CIA project aimed at gathering information on Cuba and potentially disrupting Fidel Castro's government. Think of it as a long-term intelligence-gathering mission with the ultimate goal of undermining the Cuban regime.

**Key People:**

*   **AMLASH/1 (Rolando Cubela Secades):** The star of the show. He was a high-ranking official in Cuba who secretly worked for the CIA, providing inside information.
*   **AMWHIP:** AMLASH/1's friend, acting as a go-between, helping him connect with the CIA.
*   **AMICE-14:** A CIA agent responsible for sneaking into Cuba and recruiting people like AMLASH/1.
*   **ANTRUNK:** This wasn't a person, but a series of top-secret plans for getting agents in and out of Cuba.

**How They Communicated:**

*   **S/W (Secret Writing):** Think of invisible ink. Agents used special materials to write hidden messages within seemingly normal letters.
*   **OWVL (One-Way Voice Link):** Leaving a radio receiver so that agents inside Cuba could get messages, but not send them.
*   **Using Cut-outs:** Passing information through a network of people to avoid direct contact and reduce risk.

**What Were They Trying to Do?**

*   **Gather Intelligence:** Find out what the Cuban government was planning, who the key players were, and what their weaknesses were.
*   **Recruit Agents:** Persuade influential Cubans to work for the CIA, providing even more inside information and potentially helping to overthrow Castro.
*   **Disrupt the Cuban Government:** This was the ultimate goal, using the intelligence and agents they gathered to weaken and destabilize the regime.

**What Were the Challenges?**

*   **Security:** Cuba was a hostile environment, with a strong intelligence service of its own. The CIA had to be extremely careful to protect its agents and avoid being discovered.
*   **Communication:** Getting messages in and out of Cuba secretly was difficult, requiring elaborate methods and constant vigilance.
*   **Trust:** It was hard to know who to trust, and there was always the risk that agents could be double agents working for Castro.

**What Does This All Mean?**

These documents offer a glimpse into the shadowy world of Cold War espionage, highlighting the risks, challenges, and complexities of trying to undermine a foreign government. They reveal the dedication and ingenuity of the CIA agents involved, as well as the constant struggle to maintain security and adapt to changing circumstances. Understanding Operation AMLASH provides valuable insight into the historical context of U.S.-Cuban relations and the lengths to which both sides were willing to go in their struggle for power.

**In simpler terms,** imagine a high-stakes chess game played in the shadows. Operation AMLASH was the CIA's attempt to outmaneuver Castro, using secret agents, coded messages, and elaborate plans to gain an advantage. While the full impact of AMLASH is complex, these documents offer a fascinating glimpse into a hidden chapter of history.
