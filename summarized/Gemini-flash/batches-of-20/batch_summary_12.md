# Deep Dive into CIA Operations: From Cuba to Covert Funding and Personnel Management

This summary synthesizes multiple CIA documents, providing an overarching narrative that explores various covert operations, personnel management strategies, and responses to potential public exposure during the Cold War era. It covers activities ranging from monitoring pro-Castro sentiments and training Cuban exiles to establishing elaborate cover mechanisms for agents and managing relationships with seemingly independent organizations.

## Monitoring Pro-Castro Sentiments and Activities (1961)

The documents reveal early CIA interest in individuals and groups expressing support for Fidel Castro's Cuba.

*   **Fair Play for Cuba Committee (FPCC):** In February 1961, agent Michael Stratton was tasked with cultivating a relationship with Court Wood, a student who had recently visited Cuba under the sponsorship of the FPCC. This initiative, directed by Dave Phillips of WH/4/Propaganda, aimed to gather intelligence on pro-Castro sentiments and activities.
*   **Security Concerns:** By October 1961, Stratton was advised to discontinue contact with Wood due to concerns about Wood's activities and associates. The FBI was requested to provide any additional information on Wood, particularly regarding his past associations with Stratton.

## Training Cuban Exiles and Operational Approvals (1959-1967)

The documents shed light on the CIA's involvement with Cuban exiles and their training for potential actions against the Castro regime.

*   **Laureano Batista and Movimiento Democrata Cristiano (MDC):** Laureano Batista, Secretary of Military Affairs for the MDC in Miami, received provisional operational approval (POA) in December 1959, followed by an open operational approval (OA) in February 1960, for use as a PP agent in Havana, Cuba.
*   **Training Camp in Louisiana:** Batista allegedly sent 19 men from Miami to a training camp near Lacombe, Louisiana, in 1963, at the request of Rudolph Richard Davis. The men were intended to work in a lumber business in Guatemala but became disillusioned after the FBI seized explosives nearby.

## Covert Funding and Relationships with Organizations (1951-1967)

The documents detail the CIA's use of foundations and organizations as cover for funding covert operations and influencing public opinion.

*   **Brown and Root, Inc.:** Several employees of Brown and Root, Inc., a construction company, were approved for contact use by the CIA between 1950 and 1966. This suggests that the CIA used the company for operations.
*   **Brown Foundation:** The Brown Foundation of Houston, Texas, was identified as being particularly vulnerable to exposure due to its direct ties from Agency funding instruments to legitimate foundations and Agency-sponsored projects.
*   **Vernon Fund (Project DILAMPREY):** Created in 1958, the Vernon Fund was a philanthropic foundation used as a cover and funding mechanism for Project DILAMPREY, which aimed to strengthen non-Communist teachers' organizations worldwide. This involved active support for the National Education Association (NEA/INTERN) and the World Confederation of Organizations of the Teaching Profession (WCOTP).
    *   **Damage Control:** In March 1967, after media exposure, Vernon Fund board members were instructed on how to respond to inquiries, emphasizing limited acknowledgment and declining further comment.
    *   **WCOTP Funding:** To circumvent publicity issues, a one-time infusion of money into the WCOTP bank account was proposed, backed by a letter attributing the funds to anonymous board members.
*   **American Friends of the Middle East (AFME):** Established in 1951, AFME (Project ZICINDER) aimed to promote friendship between the peoples of the Near and Middle East and the United States while combating Communism. It faced increased scrutiny in 1967 due to media exposure of its CIA affiliation.
*   **M. D. Anderson Foundation:** While there was no OS subject file on the M. D. Anderson Foundation, the M. D. Anderson Hospital and Tumor Institute engaged in classified work for the Agency, including a study on the effects of high-intensity coherent radiation.
*   **Marshall Foundation:** The Marshall Foundation of Houston, Texas, was also deemed highly vulnerable to exposure. It channeled funds from the Agency to the School of Industrial and Labor Relations at Cornell University from 1961 to 1963.

## Personnel Management and Security (1950-1968)

The documents illustrate the CIA's procedures for managing personnel, including security clearances, cover identities, and responses to potential leaks.

*   **Security Clearances:** Individuals like George Rufus Brown and Herman Brown of Brown and Root, Inc., and Thomas Dudley Cabot, were granted Covert Security Clearances for various projects.
*   **Cover Identities:** Calvin W. Hicks was given security approval for documentation under the alias "Cal William Hitch" for operational assignments in Florida. The documents reveal that steps were taken to establish official cover backstopping for Hicks.
*   **Herbert Itkin and Mario Brod:** In 1968, the CIA investigated Herbert Itkin's claims of past associations with the Agency. Despite Itkin's detailed account of meetings with Allen Dulles and a "Philip Harbin," internal records showed no evidence of these contacts or Harbin's existence. Thomas L. Roberts, a current Agency employee under deep cover in Dakar, was mentioned by Itkin as having useful contacts with the United Nations, but Roberts did not indicate any awareness of Itkin's alleged use as a CIA informant during the 1950s.
*   **Aline Mosby and Priscilla Johnson:** Information provided by Isonge Winters in December 1968 mentioned Aline Mosby, a newspaperman, and Priscilla Johnson, another newspaperwoman in Moscow. There were concerns about Johnson potentially being recruited by the Soviets due to her extensive interactions with Soviet nationals.

## Conclusion

These documents provide a glimpse into the complex and multifaceted operations of the CIA during the Cold War. They highlight the agency's efforts to monitor and influence political sentiments, fund covert activities through seemingly independent organizations, and manage personnel under strict security protocols. The findings underscore the extent to which the CIA was involved in both domestic and international affairs, often operating in the shadows to achieve its objectives.

## Making it Understandable for Someone Who Has Never Read the JFK Files:

Okay, imagine you're trying to understand a complicated puzzle with lots of scattered pieces. These CIA documents are like those puzzle pieces. Each one tells a small part of a much bigger story about what the CIA was doing during the Cold War, especially around the time of President Kennedy's assassination.

**Here's the main idea:**

The documents show the CIA was deeply involved in a lot of secret stuff. They were:

*   **Watching People:** They kept tabs on people who liked Fidel Castro's Cuba, worried about whether they were becoming communists.
*   **Training Cuban Exiles:** They were involved in training Cuban exiles to potentially fight against Castro's government.
*   **Secretly Funding Groups:** They used fake charities and foundations to funnel money to different organizations, like teacher groups, without anyone knowing it was coming from the CIA. This was to spread anti-communist ideas.
*   **Creating Fake Identities:** They made up fake identities for their spies so they could operate undercover.
*   **Handling Security Risks:** They investigated people who claimed to have worked with the CIA, to make sure they weren't lying and causing problems.
*   **Managing Agents:** They were trying to protect the identities of their agents and hide the operations they were involved in.

**Why does this matter for the JFK Files?**

These documents are being released because people want to know if the CIA was involved in President Kennedy's assassination. While these documents don't directly say the CIA killed Kennedy, they show the CIA was involved in many controversial secret activities. This leads people to ask questions about whether the CIA might have been involved in other things they haven't admitted to.

**Here are some people you should know about from the documents:**

*   **Michael Stratton:** A CIA spy who watched pro-Castro supporters.
*   **Laureano Batista:** A Cuban exile who helped train other exiles.
*   **George and Herman Brown:** They ran a big construction company that the CIA used for secret projects.
*   **Calvin W. Hicks:** A CIA agent with a fake identity.
*    **Daniel Flores:** A CIA employee with international assignments.

**In simple terms:**

These documents reveal a world of spies, secret funding, and political maneuvering. They show the CIA was very active in trying to stop the spread of communism and protect American interests, sometimes through very questionable methods. While this is a small sample of the JFK Files, they provide a context for understanding the types of activities and concerns that are raising questions about the Kennedy assassination. It allows a person to do a bit of sleuthing themselves!
