# The CIA's Web: E. Howard Hunt, Yuriy Nosenko, and Covert Operations

This summary synthesizes several classified CIA documents, revealing interconnected narratives around key figures like E. Howard Hunt and Yuriy Nosenko, as well as insights into covert operations, security protocols, and internal challenges faced by the Agency.

## E. Howard Hunt and His Memoirs: Managing Public Perception

### Reviewing "Undercover"
In September 1974, a meeting took place between CIA representatives and E. Howard Hunt, along with his legal team, to review Hunt's memoirs titled "Undercover." The primary objective was to identify and redact classified information that could potentially compromise ongoing or past operations.

*   **Classified Information:** The CIA team identified three items deemed classified:
    *   Fabrication of the Shanghai post for a Mexican operation
    *   Entry into the Guatemalan Embassy in Mexico City
    *   Joint CIA-Uruguayan telephone monitoring operation
*   **Agreed Changes:**
    *   Disguise the identity of the fabricated newspaper and remove references to journalists as agents.
    *   Make the entered embassy non-specific by deleting the word "Guatemalan."
    *   Remove references to listening posts and telephone monitoring to generalize the paragraph.
*   **Unclassified Items:** The CIA also sought modifications to 29 unclassified items, citing sensitivity. Hunt agreed to changes in some of these items, including:
    *   Deleting the names of Henry Pleasants and Frank Holcomb.
    *   Removing a direct reference to joint operations with the British in Hong Kong against China.
    *   Altering the wording regarding CIA alias documentation used by the Watergate burglars to avoid implying Agency preparation for that specific operation.

### Managing Collusion Perception

*   **Publisher Concerns:** Hunt's lawyers expressed concerns about getting the publisher to agree to the numerous changes, particularly in the unclassified sections.
*   **"Comfort Letter":** Hunt presented a "comfort letter" to the CIA, affirming his belief that the manuscript did not violate any agreements with the Agency or subject him to prosecution under espionage laws.
*   **Public Acknowledgment:** The CIA aimed to issue a press release acknowledging their review of Hunt's manuscript, hoping to dispel any notions of collusion or a CIA "whitewash" of the book.
*   **Cooperative Relationship:** Despite the need for redactions, the documents suggest a cooperative relationship between Hunt and the CIA. Hunt appeared to respect the Agency and believed his book would not harm operations or personnel.

## E. Howard Hunt and the JFK Assassination: Alias Identity

### Investigation into Alias Travel Documents

In November 1973, internal discussions and investigations were triggered by inquiries from the Special Prosecutor's office regarding U.S. passports issued to E. Howard Hunt. This led to revelations about Hunt's possession of an alias birth certificate and a tourist card.

*   **Alias Passport Inquiry:** Questions arose about whether the CIA had ever issued an alias passport to Hunt.
*   **Tourist Card Discovery:** It was revealed that Hunt possessed a tourist card in the name of Edward Hamilton.
*   **Source Identification:** The information about the tourist card came from the FBI via the U.S. Passport Office, which had initially investigated a newspaper article claiming that one of the Watergate Five had carried a U.S. passport in the name of Edward Hamilton.

### Tracing the Alias Birth Certificate

*   **Recouping Effort:** The CIA had previously attempted to recall outstanding alias birth certificates, many of which were issued in connection with the Bay of Pigs operation.
*   **Memorandum Discovery:** A memorandum dated 29 June 1970, addressed to Hunt, listed his true name and alias (Edward Joseph Hamilton). However, the memorandum was never forwarded to Hunt due to his retirement.
*   **Indexing Oversight:** The alias was not properly indexed in the CCS central index, leading to the information surfacing only during the renewed investigation.

## Yuriy Nosenko: Defection, Confinement, and Continued Service

### Background and Approval of Confinement

The documents detail the case of Yuriy Ivanovich Nosenko, a Soviet KGB officer who defected in 1964. After his defection, he was involuntarily confined by the CIA for approximately three years due to concerns about his true intentions.

*   **Initial Contact and Defection:** Nosenko first contacted Agency personnel in Switzerland in June 1962 and defected in January 1964.
*   **Involuntary Confinement:** From April 1964 to August 1965, Nosenko was confined at an Agency-controlled site in Clinton, Maryland. He was then moved to Camp Peary, Virginia, from August 1965 to October 1967.
*   **Legal Basis:** The legal justification for Nosenko's confinement was discussed with the Deputy Attorney General on 2 April 1964. The Agency General Counsel advised that such confinement was proper.

### Conditions of Confinement and Activities

*   **Conditions Established:** The conditions of Nosenko's confinement were established by the Office of Security.
*   **Congressional Briefings:** Congressional staff officers were briefed on Nosenko, with concerns for his safety and bona fides cited as reasons for prolonged confinement.
*   **Mail Cover:** A mail cover was placed on Nosenko in 1969.
*   **Florida Trip and Prostitutes:** During a pleasure trip to Florida, Agency personnel obtained the services of prostitutes for Nosenko on at least two occasions.

### Assessment and Ongoing Relationship

*   **Bona Fide Defector:** Reports from the Office of Security and the FBI concluded that Nosenko was a bona fide defector. However, a draft memorandum from the CI Staff questioned this assessment.
*   **Consultant Role:** Despite initial doubts, Nosenko continued under contract to the Agency as a consultant. He became a U.S. citizen in April 1974 and was periodically brought to Washington to consult on matters related to his background and experience.

### Concerns and Unresolved Issues

*   **Rationale for Prolonged Confinement:** The Office of Security files did not fully document the rationale for Nosenko's continued confinement beyond the initial period.
*   **Financial Aspects:** The files detail financial aspects of the case, but no final accounting had been made as the project continued.

## The Itkin Case: Navigating Complex Relationships and Legalities

### Herbert Itkin and CIA

The documents reveal Herbert Itkin's complex relationship with the CIA, focusing on his role as an informant and the subsequent legal challenges.

*   **Informant Role:** Itkin served as an unpaid witting informant in 1963, providing information on Haitian exiles attempting to unseat President Duvalier.
*   **Contact with Haitian Exiles:** Itkin's involvement included contacts with Haitian exiles in New York, Washington, the Dominican Republic, and Puerto Rico.
*   **Governmental Interest:** There was high-level governmental interest in removing Duvalier from office in 1963, with handwritten notes indicating this interest.
### Custody Battle and Legal Fallout

*   **Child Custody Dispute:** Itkin's efforts to secure custody of his wife's children led to legal complications and the exposure of CIA relationships.
*   **CIA Involvement Claim:** Affidavits were sworn stating that Mrs. Itkin had taken the children to England at the request of the CIA, with Itkin embellishing his CIA record.
*   **MONCURE's Exposure:** The CIA relationship of Bernard E. MONCURE was exposed in legal circles in New York, leading to Agency concerns about contradicting the Itkins' affidavits in court.
*   **FBI Protection:** Federal authorities provided protection to Itkin and his wife while he served as a witness in Mafia cases.

### Thomas Lee Roberts and Itkin

*   **(Thomas Lee Roberts) Involvement:** Roberts, a law partner of Itkin, became a CIA staff agent under cover in Africa. Itkin's fraudulent activities cast suspicion around Roberts, who underwent a polygraph examination.
*   **Financial Ties:** Roberts' financial ties with Itkin and the law firm were scrutinized.
*   **Meeting in Geneva:** Roberts met with Itkin in Geneva in March 1966, raising questions about whether Roberts reported these activities to the CIA.

### Request from Australian Justice

*   **Letter from A. R. Moffitt:** In November 1973, Australian Justice A. R. Moffitt requested information on the reliability of Herbert Itkin, describing him as a former CIA and FBI employee.
*   **Request for Information:** Moffitt sought information on Itkin's status from 1964 to 1969 and copies of relevant affidavits used in U.S. proceedings.
*   **CIA Response:** The CIA provided copies of public domain affidavits and stated that Itkin furnished information to the CIA over many years but was not sent to England to collect information for the Agency.

## Other Operations and Security Matters

In February 1967, the CIA requested the services of a Collins Modem Field Service Engineer to test the feasibility of transmitting Secure (encrypted) Voice over a narrow band, high-frequency, radio circuit.

*   **Specialized Equipment:** The Agency had purchased two Collins Radio Company Model TE-216D-160 High-Frequency Data Modems.
*   **Clearance:** The services of Mr. (Donald Warren Waycott) were secured, as he had an Agency TOP SECRET clearance.

### Schlumberger Well Surveying Corporation

In December 1967, an investigation was conducted into the Schlumberger Well Surveying Corporation due to allegations that the burglary of the Houma munitions bunker was "CIA-inspired."

*   **No CIA Connection:** The CIA denied any connection with the alleged burglary or the bunker itself.
*   **Contact Interest:** Pierre Schlumberger, president of the Schlumberger Corporation, was of contact interest in 1950 for routine exploitation as a foreign intelligence source.
*   **Security Concerns:** Security concerns were raised due to Schlumberger's acquisition of DAYSTRON, INC. and relationships with individuals who had communist affiliations.

### Audio Surveillance in Bethesda

In July 1963, an audio surveillance operation was initiated at a safehouse in Bethesda, Maryland, targeting Manuel F. ARTIME Buesa.

*   **Operational Support:** Mr. Charles Matt requested operational support for audio coverage of the safehouse.
*   **Listening Post:** Fred C. Thomas, Jr., a Staff employee, allowed his home to be used as a listening post.

## Conclusion

These documents offer a glimpse into the CIA's multifaceted operations during the Cold War era and beyond. From managing public perception through controlled narratives to navigating complex relationships with informants and defectors, the Agency faced numerous challenges in safeguarding national security. The documents highlight the importance of security protocols, the legal considerations surrounding covert operations, and the internal debates and concerns that shaped the Agency's actions.

## Understanding the Documents for a New Reader

These CIA files are full of information that can be hard to grasp if you're not familiar with the world of espionage. Let's break down what the key themes are and make them easier to understand.

**1. Managing Information and Public Image**

*   Imagine the CIA is trying to control a story so it doesn't hurt national security or damage its reputation.
*   **E. Howard Hunt's Memoirs:** One document shows the CIA carefully reviewing a book written by a former agent, E. Howard Hunt (later involved in the Watergate Scandal). They wanted to remove any secrets that could harm ongoing operations, but also avoid looking like they were trying to whitewash their image. Think of it like a movie studio editing a film to remove anything that could cause legal trouble.
*   **Comfort Letter**: A "comfort letter" is similar to an assurance, in this case, where E. Howard Hunt confirmed that his book wouldn't reveal classified information or break any laws.

**2. The Complex World of Espionage and Defectors**

*   These documents show how the CIA handled defectors from other countries and how complicated that could be.
*   **Yuriy Nosenko:** Nosenko was a KGB officer who defected to the U.S. The CIA wasn't sure if he was telling the truth or if he was a double agent sent to trick them. This led to him being held against his will for several years, but then ultimately being employed.
*   **Legal and Ethical Questions:** The defector situation raised tough questions: Was it legal to hold someone against their will? What were the rules for how they were treated?
**3. Covert Operations and Informants**

*   These files detail how the CIA used informants to gather information, sometimes in very sensitive situations.
*   **Herbert Itkin:** Itkin was a lawyer with connections to both the Mafia and the CIA. He provided information on a plot to overthrow the president of Haiti.
*   **Risk and Deception:** Working with informants was risky. They might be unreliable, or their past activities could create problems. The CIA had to balance the value of the information against the potential for scandal. This document also shows how the agency navigated very complex realtionships between different organizations, informants and people.

**4. Technology and Espionage**

*   The documents illustrate how important technology was to the CIA's work.
*   **Audio Surveillance:** The files describe attempts to bug a safehouse where Cuban exiles were meeting. This involved hiding microphones and setting up listening posts to record their conversations.
*   **Technical Challenges:** The CIA had to deal with technical challenges like weak signals, and finding people with the right skills to operate the equipment.

**Key Takeaways for a New Reader**

*   **Information Control:** The CIA was very concerned with managing information to protect secrets and its public image.
*   **Ethical Dilemmas:** The agency faced difficult ethical decisions when dealing with defectors, informants, and covert operations.
*   **Technology's Role:** Technology played a crucial role in gathering intelligence, but it also presented technical challenges.
