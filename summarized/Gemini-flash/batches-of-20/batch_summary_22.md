# Classified CIA Documents: A Summary of Operations and Investigations

This document summarizes several classified CIA files, encompassing a range of topics from surveillance of Soviet officials to covert operations against Cuba and investigations into individuals linked to high-profile assassinations. The documents reveal the intricacies of Cold War intelligence gathering, the complexities of managing assets, and the challenges of maintaining security.

## Ivan Dmitriyevich Obyedkov: From Suspect RIS to Unremarkable Guard

The file on Ivan Dmitriyevich Obyedkov (201-779495) details the CIA's investigation into a Soviet citizen who worked as a guard at Soviet embassies in Mexico City and Tehran.

*   **Early Suspicion:** Initially, Obyedkov was flagged as a "suspect RIS" (Russian Intelligence Service), potentially affiliated with the KGB, due to his perceived higher level of education than his guard duties would typically require.
*   **Activities:** His duties included manning the telephone, gate security, delivering messages, and occasional driving. He was noted to be security conscious. Obyedkov served as a guard at the Soviet Embassy in Mexico City from August 28, 1962, to August 4, 1965, and in Tehran from August 15, 1967, to prior to April 1971. During both tours, his wife, Yelena Lvovna, was the principal of Soviet schools. Obyedkov was born on July 28, 1927, in Ryazanskaya Oblast, and his wife, Yelena, was born on March 4, 1928, in Moscow. The couple had a son, Vladimir, born circa 1953.
*   **Lack of Evidence:** Despite initial suspicions, the CIA found no evidence of Obyedkov engaging in intelligence activities during his tours. His role appeared to be that of a legitimate guard.
*   **Conclusion:** By March 1977, the CIA decided to remove Obyedkov from the suspect RIS list, concluding that simply being a guard at a Soviet embassy did not automatically equate to being a KGB officer. This decision was communicated to London.Y in a message dated March 12, 1977.

## Illicit Armament Traffic in Costa Rica (1950)

These documents focus on the investigation of illicit arms trafficking in Costa Rica in 1950.

*   **Colombian Investigation:** The Colombian National Chief of Detectives was sent to Costa Rica to investigate clandestine movements of armaments potentially destined for Colombia. The investigation was prompted by information from the Colombian Ambassador in Costa Rica.
*   **Key Figures:** The investigation identified several individuals of interest, including:
    *   Richard ROWN, a U.S. citizen in Puerto Limon involved in arms traffic.
    *   Charles Marion LUFBORROW, an American citizen previously engaged in lumber and fishing businesses, also suspected of arms trafficking and currently in Panama.
    *   Arturo BOTERO (alias "El Vocho"), allegedly a Colombian involved in the arms trade.
    *   Carlos VALDES Gonzalez (alias Arturo ONZALEZ Molina), another Colombian working in Golfito.
*   **Communist Involvement:** The region between Palmar and Piedras Blancas was reported as heavily influenced by Communism, with potential armament deposits hidden in the area.
*   **Costa Rican Weakness:** The report concludes that the lack of a standing army in Costa Rica made it a "hot bed" for political organizations, leading to the weakness of law enforcement agencies in the country.
*   **Scholarship Proposal:** The Colombian investigator, authorized by the Colombian Ambassador to Costa Rica, Dr. Fulgencio Lequerica Velez, suggested that the Colombian government grant five scholarships to young Costa Ricans to study detective methods in Colombia to establish a technical police corps in Costa Rica.

## Luis Posada Carriles: Covert Operations and Connections to Bombings

This file details the CIA's management of Luis Posada Carriles (201-300985), a Cuban exile involved in covert operations.

*   **Cover Employment:** In August 1966, Posada began working for RECE, a Cuban exile organization in Miami. He was simultaneously paid by the CIA to report on RECE's activities. To maintain security, he could no longer use Tri-State Engineering Service as his cover employment.
*   **Tri-State Engineering Service:** Previously, the CIA had arranged "action and status cover" with Tri-State Engineering Service, Inc. for both Posada and Alberto de Jesus Alberty Garcia. Tri-State Engineering Service was located at 800 First National Bank Building, Miami 32, Florida. This was intended as the cover story for CIA operatives; it was important they advised Tri-State Engineering Service, Inc, of all the relevant information, so they could correctly fill in the paperwork for the VA.
*   **Involvement with Frank "Lefty" Rosenthal:** In June 1967, the Department of Justice was investigating Frank "Lefty" Rosenthal, believed to be tied to Miami crime figures and involved in bombings in the Miami area.
*   **AMCLEVE/15 as Intermediary:** Rosenthal allegedly approached Norman Rothman, who connected him with AMCLEVE/15, known to be affiliated with WOFACT (a CIA front organization). Rosenthal claimed AMCLEVE/15 supplied him with explosives, caps, and primers.
*   **CIA Concerns and Cooperation with FBI:** The CIA was concerned about whether materials given to Rosenthal were of WOFACT origin. AMCLEVE/15 was cooperating with the FBI, and the CIA was considering using Posada Carriles to assist Rosenthal in obtaining additional materials to facilitate Rosenthal's arrest.
*   **Allegations of Bombing Involvement:** Albert Larrain Maestre allegedly admitted to Posada Carriles his involvement in the bombings with Rosenthal. Larrain was a fugitive under a narcotics indictment.

## James Earl Ray and the Assassination of Martin Luther King Jr.

These documents relate to the identification and pursuit of James Earl Ray, the accused assassin of Martin Luther King Jr.

*   **Positive Identification:** By April 1968, LNERGO (likely a liaison service) had positively identified the accused assassin as James Earl Ray, born March 10, 1928, in Illinois.
*   **Physical Description and Aliases:** Ray was described as approximately 5'10", weighing 163-174 pounds, with blue eyes, brown hair, and a small scar on his forehead and a scar on the palm of his right hand. He used aliases including James McBride, James Walton, W. C. Herron, and James O'Connor.
*   **Background:** Ray had served in the U.S. Army, was discharged as "inept and unable to adjust," had been confined to a mental hospital, and had a criminal record for burglary, armed robbery, and forgery. He had been missing from the Missouri State Penitentiary since April 23, 1967, and was considered armed and extremely dangerous.
*   **Worldwide Alert:** Information and photos of Ray, previously identified as Eric Starvo Galt, were distributed to multiple CIA stations worldwide, requesting efforts to determine if he was or had been in their area. The documents also requested that all information reported be evaluated as to reliability and that as much detail as possible be provided, including any information to the legal attach√© if applicable. An identikit composite was constructed using the code: H 50 C 32 X 2 B 31 D 82 N 35 X 2 L 28 X 2

## Cuban Operations and Individuals of Interest

These documents reflect the CIA's involvement in Cuban affairs, both pre- and post-revolution.

*   **Internal Resistance:**  Documents from October 1961 show Manolo Ray, an exile leader of the Movimiento Revolucionario del Pueblo (MRP - People's Revolutionary Movement), was against any invasion of Cuba. Ray insisted the overthrow of Castro was to be achieved by internal resistance. Ray also claimed that the MRP was organized throughout the island and supported by all classes of the population, had members in all 33 trade unions, the G-2, militia, and throughout the administration.
*   **Anti-Castro Activities:** In December 1958, as the Cuban Revolution was unfolding, the CIA received reports that Ernesto "Che" Guevara had moved westward in Cuba and was aiming to cut off the central highway traffic west of Santa Clara.

## Cira Martinez and Manuel Ray: Anti-Castro Efforts

These documents detail the CIA's interest in Cira Martinez and Manuel Ray, both figures involved in anti-Castro activities.

*   **Cira Martinez's Connections:**  An October 1962 report indicated that Cira "Cirita" Martinez was closely connected to Manuel Ray.  She used the pseudonym "Josefina" and was married to architect Frank Martinez. Both were trusted by Ray.
*   **Dissatisfaction with Ray's Politics:**  The source claimed Josefina (Cira Martinez) was dissatisfied with Ray's political actions and had refused to join the executive of his organization, J.U.R.E., due to disagreements.  She described J.U.R.E. as similar to Castroism, merely changing the leader's name.
*  **Manolo Ray, Potential Defectors within the Castro Regime:** In October 1962, the CIA sought out a list of defectors who were against Castro, with Manolo Ray proving a willing supplier. Ray provided an extensive list of potential defectors within the Castro regime, which included high-ranking officials in Cuba.
**Pico Roman, Reinaldo:** From July 1964 - July 1969, Pico Roman had numerous requests to obtain a Green list from Caracas. He was a Cuban with ties as a correspondent for a daily "Excelsior" and previously a member of the 26th of July Movement. The documents also reflected various dates of travel during these years including the U.S. and Caracas.

## Conclusion

These classified CIA documents provide a glimpse into the operational landscape of the Cold War era, highlighting the agency's focus on gathering intelligence, managing covert operations, and countering perceived threats. The files reveal the complexities of intelligence work, the challenges of assessing individuals' true allegiances, and the constant need to adapt to evolving geopolitical realities. From surveilling Soviet officials to supporting anti-Castro movements and investigating assassinations, these documents offer valuable insights into the strategies and tactics employed by the CIA during a turbulent period in history. The documents also reveal how the CIA was willing to work with individuals with various alleged activities as a means to combat Communism.

## Explanation for Readers Unfamiliar with JFK Files

Okay, let's break down these documents in a way that's easier to understand if you've never seen anything like this before. These are all real documents declassified by the CIA, and they give us a peek into the kinds of things the agency was doing, especially during the Cold War and related conflicts. It's like looking at someone's diary, but instead of personal feelings, it's about secret operations and investigations.

Here's a simplified overview:

*   **What are these documents about?** They cover a few different stories:
    *   **A Soviet Guard (Obyedkov):** The CIA was keeping tabs on a Soviet citizen working as a guard at their embassies in different countries. They suspected he might be more than just a guard ‚Äì possibly a KGB spy.
    *   **Arms Smuggling in Costa Rica:** The CIA was investigating illegal weapons being smuggled into Costa Rica, potentially linked to communist groups.
    *   **A Cuban Exile (Posada Carriles):** The CIA was working with a Cuban exile in Miami, who was involved with both anti-Castro groups and, strangely, a man connected to criminal bombings.
    *   **Martin Luther King Jr.'s Assassin (James Earl Ray):** After King's assassination, the CIA was involved in identifying and tracking down the suspect, James Earl Ray.
    *   **Anti-Castro Efforts in Cuba:** The CIA investigated internal resistance within the Castro Regime through sources.

*   **Why are these documents so hard to read?**
    *   **Secrecy:** They're written in code words, abbreviations, and jargon to keep information secret. For example, "RIS" means "Russian Intelligence Service."
    *   **Bureaucracy:** There's a lot of administrative stuff ‚Äì who sent the message, who received it, file numbers, etc. ‚Äì which can be confusing.
    *   **Deletions:** Some parts are blacked out ("DELETIONS, IF ANY") to protect sensitive information even now.

*   **Key things to understand:**
    *   **Cold War Context:** This was a time of intense rivalry between the U.S. and the Soviet Union. Both sides were spying on each other and trying to undermine each other's influence.
    *   **Cuban Exiles:** After Fidel Castro took power in Cuba, many Cubans fled to the United States, especially to Florida. Some of these exiles were involved in efforts to overthrow Castro, sometimes with the CIA's help.
    *   **Covert Operations:** These are secret activities, often involving deception, sabotage, or even violence, that governments undertake without publicly acknowledging them.
    *   **Assets:** These are people who work for the CIA, either as full-time employees or as informants.
    *   **Liaison:** This refers to cooperating or sharing information with other intelligence agencies, either domestic (like the FBI) or foreign.

*   **The bottom line:**
    *   These documents show the CIA was very active in trying to understand and influence events around the world.
    *   They were willing to work with some questionable people to achieve their goals.
    *   They were concerned about both external threats (like the Soviet Union) and internal threats (like domestic unrest and potential subversion).
    *   The investigations were focused on information sharing, counter measures, and the ability to track people through the CIA and to foreign intelligence services.

Hopefully, this makes the summary (and the original documents) a bit more accessible! It's like learning a new language ‚Äì once you understand the basics, it gets easier.
