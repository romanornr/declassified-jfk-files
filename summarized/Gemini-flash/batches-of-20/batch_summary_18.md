## Operation AMSPELL: Covert CIA Activities Against Castro's Cuba

This summary synthesizes classified CIA documents related to Operation AMSPELL, a multifaceted campaign designed to destabilize Fidel Castro's regime in Cuba during the early to mid-1960s. These documents reveal the CIA's involvement with Cuban exile groups, their intelligence gathering efforts, propaganda dissemination, and paramilitary actions. The operation was plagued by internal conflicts, infiltration by Cuban intelligence, and questionable effectiveness, despite significant financial investment.

**I. Context: Destabilizing Castro's Cuba**

Following the Cuban Revolution in 1959, the CIA initiated various covert operations aimed at undermining Castro's communist government. Operation AMSPELL was a key component of these efforts, utilizing Cuban exiles as assets for intelligence gathering, propaganda, and potential paramilitary actions. The documents highlight the CIA's efforts to support and control these exile groups, while simultaneously managing the risks associated with their activities.

**II. Key Themes and Activities:**

*   **Intelligence Gathering and Infiltration:** The CIA sought to gather intelligence on the Cuban government, military installations, and internal resistance movements through Cuban exile networks. Documents reveal the use of "AMHINTs" (Cuban exile intelligence agents) to collect information and infiltrate Cuban organizations.
    *   **Example:** On **February 15, 1961**, **Agent 2515** is dispatched to Havana to contact **LADREA "LOUISA" GIQUEL** to infiltrate the **A-3** movement line to the Escambray mountains as a W/T operator for the **OSVALDO RAMIREZ GROUP**. However, due to a security incident involving G2 raiding Giquel's house near **13th Ave and 198 ST, Biltmore, Habana**, and the capture of **VIKING II RADIO** and **GN58 HAND GENERATORS**, Agent 2515 is instructed to avoid contact.
    *   **Finding:** Efforts were made on **November 8, 1962**, to acquire miniature cameras through **JOSE ARTECONA** to transmit them to **PBRUMEN** through **IDEN B**. **IDEN A** informed **KARNLEY** that he was in contact locally with **DRE** and that Artecona has been seeking assistance to obtain the cameras.
*   **Propaganda and Psychological Warfare:** AMSPELL aimed to influence public opinion both in Cuba and internationally through various propaganda initiatives, including radio broadcasts, newsletters, and press releases.
    *   **Example:** The AMHINTS in PBRUMEN continue to produce "Trinchera" on a hand-operated mimeograph machine in Havana and distribute about 10,000 copies monthly in **September 1962**.
    *   **Finding:** In **September 1962**, to implement such a policy, AMSPELL has exploited the impact of their **August 24** attack on PBPRIME news media, as well as their Caracas Declaration. Also, they have published a weekly news letter in English entitled "The Cuban Report" and about 1,000 copies are mailed out to ODYOKE officials and congressmen. Initiated in late August, the main theme of this publication has been the Soviet/Bloc materiel buildup in PBRUMEN.
*   **Paramilitary Actions:** The CIA supported and encouraged paramilitary actions by Cuban exile groups, such as attacks on Cuban ships and infrastructure.
    *   **Example:** On **November 15, 1960**, **AMYUMS** reported **GOC** picked up the fall-out: 20 pistols, 6 submachine guns and one bazooka, surmising the above may have been contents one bundle which fell on the Trinidad highway.
    *   **Finding:** In **August 1964**, the Dominican Air Force and the Dominican Navy are allowing craft manned by Cuban exiles to cache arms and other supplies on the Dominican coast at Las Pena. And Punta Luna, south of Monte Cri. The boats arrive and depart quickly, with permission from the Dominican Navy, to cache their cargo. Arms and other supplies are not of Dominican origin.

*   **Financial Support and Management:** The CIA provided significant financial support to AMSPELL and its affiliated groups, but struggled to maintain control over how these funds were used.
    *   **Example:** The total AMSPELL support for **September 1962** was **$50,960.40**.
    *   **Finding:** In **January through June 1966**, the primary reason for the reduction of AMSPELL's financial support was the inconsistencies of many AMSPELL activities with current WOFACT directives.
*   **Internal Conflicts and Infiltration:** Operation AMSPELL was plagued by internal conflicts between exile groups and infiltration by Cuban intelligence agents.
    *   **Example:** On **January 4, 1963**, AMHINT-27 met with QUANTUM-51 in New York City, and QUANTUM-50 advised him that Jorge MEDINA Bringuier, the Secretary General of AMSPELL in PBRUMEN, Is a G-2 agent. MEDINA and AEDO, who was said by QUANTUM-50 to be on the AMSPELL National Executive, were actually G-2 penetrations. They planned to "roll up" the eptiro AMSPELL organization and "other groups" in one sweep and then escape by boat and contact AMRINT-53 in the JMWAVE area. MEDINA was in contact with AMBINT-53 while in PORUMEN and planned to use AMHINT-53 to establish his bona fides with KUBARK.
    *   **Finding:** In a letter on **23 November 1962**, there were cases of paying out $20.00 (November's assistance) when the lady had a still-born baby. Malanga and Fernando receive the money every two weeks, that is why they show twice in the list.

**III. Significant People:**

*   **Evelio Duque:** Mentioned in multiple documents, Evelio Duque appears to have been a significant figure within the anti-Castro movement, receiving support for his forces in the Escambray region.
*   **Robert M. Geddes:** Involved in the coordination of airdrops to anti-Castro forces in **December 1960**.
*   **Collin E. Ostrander:** USIA Representative, San Juan, **IDEN A**.
*   **Waldemar F. Lee:** Netherlands Consul, San Juan, **IDEN B**.
*   **Susan Heiligman Frank:** Subject of extensive FBI and CIA scrutiny, associated with communist front organizations and potentially involved in activities related to China.
*   **Richard Cyril Frank:** Husband of Susan Heiligman Frank, also under investigation for communist ties.
*   **Carlos Prio Socarras:** Former President of Cuba, involved in questionable financial transactions and potentially offering intelligence material to the U.S. government.
*   **Jorge Medina Bringuier:** Secretary General of AMSPELL in PBRUMEN and a double agent working for G-2.
*   **Vicente Mendez:** Captain for Alpha 66.

**IV. Key Events and Locations:**

*   **Havana, Cuba:** The epicenter of the CIA's covert activities, including intelligence gathering, propaganda dissemination, and support for underground resistance movements.
*   **Escambray Mountains, Cuba:** A region of significant anti-Castro guerilla activity, targeted for support by the CIA.
*   **Miami, Florida:** A major hub for Cuban exile groups and CIA operations, serving as a base for training, funding, and coordination.
*   **Latin America:** AMSPELL conducted tours in Latin American countries during a five-month period, February-June 1964. With the exception of Guayaquil and La Paz -- where excellent results were achieved the tour was only moderately successful, and must be classified a failure in Quito, Santiago and Montevideo.

**V. Operational Shortcomings and Failures:**

*   **Poor Coordination:** The documents highlight a lack of coordination between different CIA stations, leading to potential risks and compromised operations.
    *   **Example:** San Juan elected to handle the matter in a way so as to avoid crossing the WAVE channel to DRE.
*   **Infiltration and Double Agents:** The presence of Cuban intelligence agents within AMSPELL and other exile groups undermined the CIA's efforts and led to the arrest and execution of operatives.
*   **Questionable Effectiveness:** Despite significant investment, AMSPELL's propaganda and paramilitary activities had limited impact on the Castro regime and were often counterproductive.
*   **Internal Disputes and Personal Conflicts:** personality clashes with the local AMBARBs and the consequent poor performance by the AMSPELL team, who complained of the absence of police protection, adequate facilities for the exhibit, etc., and departed just two days later on the 27th.

**VI. Concerns Regarding U.S. Legality and Ethics:**

*   **Neutrality Act Violations:** The CIA's support for paramilitary actions by Cuban exile groups raised concerns about violating U.S. neutrality laws.
*   **Ethical Considerations:** The documents allude to questionable financial practices and potentially illegal activities by some of the individuals involved in Operation AMSPELL, raising ethical concerns about the CIA's association with these individuals.

**VII. Conclusion:**

The documents relating to Operation AMSPELL provide a glimpse into the CIA's covert efforts to destabilize Fidel Castro's Cuba during the Cold War. While the operation involved significant resources and manpower, it was hampered by internal conflicts, infiltration, and questionable effectiveness. The documents also raise ethical and legal concerns about the CIA's involvement with Cuban exile groups and their activities. The operation reflects the complex and often problematic nature of covert operations during this period. The long-term implications of findings is a possibility to analyze this findings to find the truth about the situation.

**VIII. Simplified Explanation for Readers Unfamiliar with JFK Files:**

Imagine the CIA trying to secretly get rid of a government they didn't like in Cuba, led by Fidel Castro, back in the 1960s. They used Cuban exiles (people who had fled Cuba and were against Castro) to do this.

This operation, called AMSPELL, involved:

*   **Spies:** The CIA tried to plant spies within Cuba to gather information and cause trouble for Castro's government.
*   **Propaganda:** They created radio shows, newsletters, and news stories to make Castro look bad and encourage people to resist him.
*   **Secret Attacks:** The CIA supported Cuban exile groups who launched attacks on Cuba, like sinking fishing boats.
*   **Money Problems:** The CIA spent a lot of money on this operation, but it was hard to keep track of where the money was going.
*   **Double Agents:** Some of the people the CIA thought were helping them were actually working for Castro, which caused a lot of problems.

The CIA also investigated two people named Susan and Richard Frank, who they thought might be secretly working for communist China. The documents included in this file are related to the investigation and the Frank's activities.

In the aftermath of JFK's assassination, the assassination records act was passed to get to the bottom of things and to make sure that there was no conspiracy or cover-up.

Basically, this operation was a mess. The different exile groups fought with each other, some were spies working for Castro, and it didn't really do much to hurt Castro's government. It shows how difficult and messy it can be to try and secretly influence what's happening in another country.
