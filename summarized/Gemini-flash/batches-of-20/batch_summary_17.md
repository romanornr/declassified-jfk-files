# CIA Activities Regarding Cuban Exiles, Orlando Bosch, and Related Operations (1967-1975)

This summary synthesizes classified CIA and FBI documents from 1967 to 1975, focusing on the agency's monitoring and involvement with Cuban exile groups, particularly the Movimiento Insurreccional de Recuperacion Revolucionaria (MIRR) and its leader, Orlando Bosch Avila. These documents reveal a complex web of surveillance, potential operational support, and concerns over violent activities carried out by these groups against the Castro regime in Cuba, as well as the agency's interactions with individuals connected to these organizations.

## MIRR and Orlando Bosch Avila: Anti-Castro Activities

*   **Formation and Objectives:** The MIRR, also known as Cuban Power, was an anti-Castro organization led by Orlando Bosch Avila, headquartered in Miami, Florida. Bosch was noted for his involvement in numerous revolutionary acts, some of which involved violence.

*   **Bombing Activities:** The documents highlight MIRR's involvement in bombing activities, including a 1968 communication to the Associated Press claiming responsibility for sabotaging Havana's "Nico" oil refinery and a feed factory. FBI investigations were initiated into these activities.

*   **Financial Support and Planning:** In 1967, Bosch allegedly planned a bombing mission over Cuba, seeking to rent an airplane to drop bombs on a sugar mill. The plan involved financing between $3,500 and $4,000 and employing a pilot and two others, indicating a willingness to engage in direct attacks against Cuban infrastructure.

*   **US Government Response:** The documents reveal that U.S. authorities were aware of Bosch's activities, with the FBI and other agencies conducting investigations. In April 1967, several individuals, including Bosch, were considered for charges related to violations of the Arms Control Act, Conspiracy, and Neutrality Act.

## CIA Monitoring and Operational Considerations

*   **Surveillance:** The CIA and FBI were actively monitoring Bosch and the MIRR, tracking their activities, contacts, and potential threats. This included intercepting communications, gathering information from sources within the Cuban exile community, and coordinating with other government agencies.

*   **Operational Concerns:** The documents raise concerns about the impact of Bosch's trial on CIA operations and security. There was also interest in knowing whether electronic surveillance had been employed against Bosch and his associates.

*   **Potential Alliance with Other Groups:** The documents mention the formation of a Cuban-Haitian emigre alliance with the goal of invading Haiti, indicating a broader network of anti-communist groups in the Caribbean region.

*   **Robin Moore and Blue Hole, Jamaica:** In 1963, the CIA assessed the potential use of Robin Moore and his property in Blue Hole, Jamaica, as a base of operations for activities against Cuba. Moore, a veteran of the American Special Forces in Vietnam, was willing to provide limited support but unwilling to commit his property as a long-term staging area. Blue Hole was deemed an excellent harbor, but logistical challenges, such as the lack of marine white gasoline, were noted.

## Connections and Individuals of Interest

*   **George de Mohrenschildt:** A contact report from May 1963 mentions George de Mohrenschildt in connection with M. Charles, discussing the situation in Haiti. This connection is noteworthy due to de Mohrenschildt's later association with Lee Harvey Oswald.

*   **Rogelio Cisneros:** Starting in 1967, Rogelio Cisneros, a naturalized U.S. citizen, is mentioned in several reports as a source of information regarding political and economic conditions in Honduras. His contacts and business connections in Central America and the Caribbean made him a valuable asset for gathering intelligence. There are also mentions of Honduran politicians with ties to Venezuela who are interested in welfare of Honduran people.
*   **Jean Saurel:** In 1965, Jean Saurel, a Haitian official, came under scrutiny due to his alleged connections to the Ton Ton Macoutes and President Duvalier. His associations with George and Jeane DEMOHRENSCHILDT, who were acquainted with Lee Harvey Oswald, further complicated the matter.

*   **AMCORE-2:** Refers to an agent involved in procurement of aircraft in 1963, to support operations. The agent is instructed to establish cover stories and secure funds for chartering a replacement plane.

*   **Thomas E. Davis:** A CIA asset since 1952, involved in mapping work. Internal memos show various requests to confirm his operational status and check his background.

## Observations on internal operations

* The documents reveal a complex network of assets, code names and code words, including: AMCORE, JHPALM and JMWAVE.

* Some of the older assets are involved in counter intelligence activity including tracking communists both overseas and inside the United States.

* Several points of contact appear in the documents from around the world including Europe, Central America, the Caribbean, the United States, the then Soviet Union.

## Concluding Summary and Implications

These documents paint a picture of the CIA and FBI deeply involved in monitoring and potentially supporting Cuban exile groups in their efforts to destabilize or overthrow the Castro regime. The narrative underscores the agency's utilization of various assets, its concerns over security and operational effectiveness, and its navigation of complex political relationships within the Cuban exile community.

The documents also highlight the agency's connections with individuals who would later become central to the investigation of the Kennedy assassination, such as George de Mohrenschildt, raising questions about the full extent of the agency's knowledge and involvement.

The implications of these findings are significant. They suggest that the CIA was not merely passively observing the activities of Cuban exiles but was actively engaged in gathering intelligence, assessing operational opportunities, and managing potential threats. This raises ethical and legal questions about the agency's role in supporting groups known for violence and its potential impact on U.S. foreign policy.

**Summary for someone who doesn't know the JFK files:**

Okay, imagine this: back in the 1960s and 70s, there were a lot of people who had fled Cuba after Fidel Castro took over. Many of them ended up in the United States, especially in Miami, and they were NOT happy about Castro. Some of these exiles formed groups to try to overthrow Castro, and some of them were willing to use violence to do it.

The documents you've read are like secret memos from the CIA and FBI about these Cuban exile groups. One group, called MIRR, and its leader, Orlando Bosch, are a big focus. The agencies were watching them closely because they were involved in bombings and other potentially dangerous activities against Cuba.

Think of it like this: the CIA was trying to figure out what these exile groups were up to, who was involved, and whether they posed a threat to U.S. interests. They were using informants, tracking communications, and even considering whether to use certain individuals or locations as bases of operation.

What's really interesting is that some of the people the CIA was keeping an eye on, like George de Mohrenschildt, later became connected to the investigation into the assassination of President Kennedy. This raises questions about how much the CIA knew about these individuals and groups, and whether there was any connection between their activities and the assassination. It's like finding a piece of a puzzle that might fit into a bigger picture, but you're not sure exactly how.

So, these documents are important because they give us a glimpse into the secret world of Cold War espionage, the complex relationships between the U.S. government and Cuban exiles, and the potential connections to one of the biggest mysteries in American history.
