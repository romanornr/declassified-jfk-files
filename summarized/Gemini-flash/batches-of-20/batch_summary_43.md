# A Tangled Web: CIA and FBI Interactions During the Cold War and Beyond

This summary compiles multiple classified FBI and CIA documents, primarily from the Cold War era, revealing the intricate, often cooperative, and sometimes contentious relationship between the two agencies. The documents shed light on joint operations, intelligence sharing, and areas of jurisdictional dispute.

## I. Project HUNTER: Joint Mail Intercept Program

The documents reveal a highly sensitive joint operation, Project HUNTER, initiated by the CIA to intercept and analyze mail going to and from the Soviet Union starting approximately in 1956. The FBI became involved in 1958.

*   **CIA's Operation:** The CIA was photographing envelopes and later opening mail, microfilming contents, and indexing data using IBM machines. The operation, costing over a million dollars annually, involved two to three hundred CIA employees. The goal was to identify individuals behind the Iron Curtain who might have ties in the U.S. and could be approached as contacts and sources for the CIA.
*   **FBI's Concerns:** The FBI, alerted to the CIA's activities through inquiries with Post Office officials in New York, was concerned about potential jurisdictional overlap and the identification of illegal espionage agents in the U.S.
*   **Information Sharing:** To address these concerns, the FBI and CIA agreed to share information. The FBI designated information received from the CIA under Project HUNTER as "Bureau Informant 200." The FBI would provide the CIA with names and addresses of interest, and the CIA would flag any relevant communications. The FBI also requested that the CIA furnish information of a suspicious nature such as that containing double talk, et cetera; correspondence indicating pressure being exerted on Soviet citizens who have close relatives in the U.S. or pressure being exerted on individuals in U.S; and weaknesses or dissatisfaction on the part of any Soviet presently in the United States.
*   **Communication Protocols:** Communication between the FBI and CIA regarding Project HUNTER was highly formalized, with specific protocols for submitting trace requests, handling watch lists, and ensuring the security of the operation. Intercepts on individuals of interest resulted in reproduction of the exterior, or exterior and content of the intercepted mail.
*   **Ongoing Collaboration:** As late as 1972, the FBI was still providing the CIA with a list of types of traffic that would be of assistance, including information on Soviet exchange students, official visitors, and contacts involving persons on the Watch List.

## II. Cooperation and Tensions in Counterintelligence

The documents also illuminate the broader context of FBI-CIA relations, marked by both cooperation and competition in counterintelligence.

*   **Operational Coordination:** The FBI and CIA coordinated on matters of mutual interest, such as sharing information on Soviet intelligence activities and potential security threats. They also agreed on protocols for handling alien interview requests and conducting joint operations.
*   **Jurisdictional Disputes:** Despite the cooperation, tensions existed, particularly concerning the scope of domestic operations and the sharing of information. J. Edgar Hoover expressed concern about the FBI revealing too much about its domestic operations to the CIA.
*   **CIA Laboratory Access:** In 1961, the CIA established a laboratory in New York that can examine correspondence for secret writing, micro dots and possibly codes. In 1967, the FBI requested and received a tour of the FBI laboratory for three CIA personnel.
*   **CIA Contribution to National Council of Churches:** In March 1967, an FBI source indicated the CIA had contributed at least one million dollars to the National Council of Churches. He also believed the CIA maintained a "safe house at the Airle House, Warrenton, Virginia." The FBI considered advising the CIA of the allegation through appropriate channels.

## III. Cuban Intelligence and Anti-Castro Activities

A significant portion of the documents focuses on Cuban intelligence activities and anti-Castro efforts, revealing collaboration and competing interests between the FBI and CIA.

*   **Cuban Exile Monitoring:** The FBI monitored Cuban exile groups in the U.S. and their activities, including potential invasion attempts and plots against Fidel Castro.
*   **Double Agents:** The FBI used Cuban aliens as double agents, such as one code-named "FISHFACE", who were directed against Cuban intelligence services. These agents were tasked with gathering information on anti-Castro activities in the U.S.
*   **Potential Assassination Plots:** The documents allude to a possible CIA plan to assassinate Fidel Castro, which was allegedly shelved due to opposition from Attorney General Robert Kennedy but later revived with President Johnson's knowledge.
*   **Intelligence on Key Figures:** The documents mention several individuals involved in Cuban politics, including Alberto Bayo, linked to revolutionary activities, and Rolando L. Cubela y Secades, a Cuban government official who was in contact with the CIA and potentially involved in plans against Castro.
*   **Monitoring of Travel:** In 1960, a report indicated that an FBI source was monitoring travel. The FBI received information that VALENTIN VASILEVICH BAKULIN made a trip to Los Angeles in January 1960.
*   **"Comite Pro-Liberacion de los Cien" (CPLLC):** It was discovered that the FBI does not interview Cuban refugees in Buildings T90 or T94, rather the CIA conducts interviews under the guise of the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service. JORGE RAUL ROBLEJO LORIE was being investigated by the FBI due to suspicion he was involved in intelligence activities. On June 29, 1967, it was reported that LUIS RICARDO ALONSO, former Cuban Ambassador to London, had been in correspondence with Cuban Intelligence figure REINALDO ABREU. It was also discovered that a security guard at the Miami Airport, SERGIO OSWALDO BETANCOURT COLLAZO, revealed ROBLEJO was interested in the activities at the airport where refugees are processed, and asked if the FBI was there, and if BETANCOURT could provide photographs of documents or people the FBI investigated.

## IV. Other Notable Intelligence Activities

*   **Protecting CIA Employees from Kidnapping:** In 1967, the FBI coordinated with the CIA to obtain fingerprints and photographs of the family of CIA employee Thomas Keogh after receiving information the Communist Party of Venezuela may attempt to kidnap Keogh's child.
*   **Threats Against the President:** In December 1964, the FBI reviewed individuals considered to be a possible threat to the President residing in Switzerland and Austria. No one was found.
*   **Mark Lane Investigation:** In May 1964, the FBI disseminated information concerning Mark Lane to Austrian and Swiss authorities.
*   **James Angleton as FBI Source:** In 1953, the FBI established a control file to handle information received from James Angleton, a CIA official in charge of Special Projects. Angleton, described as a confidential informant, provided the FBI with valuable information and insights into CIA operations. The Israel Intelligence Service was his primary source.

## Conclusion

These documents paint a detailed picture of the complex relationship between the FBI and CIA during the Cold War and beyond. While cooperation was crucial for national security, the agencies also navigated jurisdictional boundaries and conflicting priorities. The documents highlight the critical importance of intelligence sharing, the challenges of maintaining security, and the ever-present tensions between domestic and foreign intelligence operations. The use of human sources, technical surveillance, and double agents underscores the multifaceted nature of intelligence gathering during this period. The cases involving Cuban intelligence and anti-Castro activities illustrate the persistent challenges of managing covert operations and the delicate balance between political objectives and legal constraints.
## Simplified Summary for Readers Unfamiliar with the JFK Files

Okay, imagine you're watching a Cold War spy movie, but instead of just one hero agency, you have two – the FBI and the CIA – constantly working together, but also bumping heads. These documents are like behind-the-scenes memos and reports that give you a real look at what they were doing. Since this is about the JFK files, I will emphasize the things that have to do with Cuba.

**What's this about?**

*   **A Secret Mail Project:** The CIA had a super-secret program called "Project HUNTER" where they were intercepting and reading mail to and from the Soviet Union. It was a massive undertaking, like something out of a movie! The FBI found out and was a little worried, partly because they also wanted to catch spies. So, they decided to work together and share information. Since this is related to the JFK files, the FBI had Cuban intelligence agents they called "FISHFACE" and had them gather intelligence for the agencies.
*  **Other Spy Stuff:** The FBI and CIA were also working together on other things, like catching Soviet spies in America. But, sometimes they didn't quite trust each other and had their own ways of doing things.
*   **Cuba Focus:** A big part of their attention was on Cuba, especially after the revolution. The agencies were trying to figure out what Fidel Castro was up to, and were monitoring anti-Castro groups in the U.S. Think of it as a super-tense game of chess.

**Why does this matter for the JFK files?**

*   **Secret Missions:** Some documents hint at secret missions against Castro, possibly even assassination plots.
*   **Exiles:** There are reports of Cuban exiles, some who might have been involved in shady dealings with the U.S. government.
*   **Tangled relationships:** It gives some insight into the type of covert relationships being cultivated.

**In plain words:**

These documents are like pieces of a puzzle. They show the FBI and CIA cooperating and competing, all while trying to protect America during a dangerous time. It's messy, secretive, and full of people who weren't always on the same page. All of this is relevant to the JFK files as it may shed light on why certain events happened.
