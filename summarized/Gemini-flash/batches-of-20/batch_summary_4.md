The documents highlight the CIA's use of journalists, Cuban exiles, and other individuals as sources of information, operational support, and propaganda outlets, while also detailing the challenges and risks associated with maintaining these clandestine networks.

## JMWAVE's Relationship with AMCARBON-1 (April 2, 1964)

This dispatch focuses on JMWAVE's operational relationship with AMCARBON-1, a journalist working for an identified major South Florida news media outlet (Identity 3). The relationship was cultivated to ensure the security of JMWAVE's operations and to provide an outlet for surfacing selected propaganda items.

*   **Background**: The relationship with AMCARBON-1 evolved from actions taken in September 1962 to prevent a security breach related to the establishment of a sensitive operation (Identity 2) that was being kept from the YOBELT South Campus. The initial contact was AMCARBON-2, who introduced REUTEMAN (JMWAVE representative) to AMCARBON-1 in December 1962.
*   **Ground Rules**: AMCARBON-2 outlined the ground rules for AMCARBON-1, emphasizing that the Identity 3 would not deliberately embarrass KUBARK (CIA) or its South Florida operations. Any potentially embarrassing information would be brought to REUTEMAN's attention for guidance on how to handle it.
*   **AMCARBON-1's Role**: AMCARBON-1 started working for the Identity 3 in 1957 and advanced to cover major political developments in Florida, eventually becoming a Identity 4. Despite not being an expert on Latin America, he showed a keen interest in becoming a specialist in the area.
*   **Sources and Contacts**: AMCARBON-1 protected his sources but occasionally identified them to REUTEMAN, including:
    *   Luis FERNANDEZ Rocha (secretary general of the DRE)
    *   Manolo RAY Rivero (chief of JURE)
    *   Carlos FODD y Lobo (of the defunct Havana Times)
    *   AMBIDDY-1
    *   Aureliano SANCHEZ Arango (leader of the AAA)
    *   Edmund LEAHY (of the Washington News Bureau, with a daughter working for Attorney General Robert KENNEDY)
    *   Frank FIORINI (free-lance pilot and adventurer)
    *   Eduardo SUAREZ Riva (public relations man for the MRR)
    *   Luis MUNOZ Marin (governor of Puerto Rico)
    *   Juan BOSCH Gavino (former president of the Dominican Republic)
    *   Charles KEELY (of the Copley Wire Service)
    *   Jorge VOLSKY Kraisler (USIA employee in Miami, also a stringer for the New York Times)
*   **Operational Support**: AMCARBON-1 was used for operational support tasks, such as locating Andrew ORDONO Camps in Houston, Texas, and discrediting Carlos BANDIN of the MRR Splinter Group by influencing media coverage.
*   **Operational Intelligence**: AMCARBON-1 provided intelligence on various topics, including the return of AMBEND-1 to Miami, the Identity 3's interest in a Bay of Pigs article, and the presence of Trevor ARMBRISTER researching stories about missiles in Cuban caves.
*   **Propaganda Outlet**: AMCARBON-1 was used to surface propaganda items, such as the AMCRAB-1 defection story, the Charles GRIFFIN shrimp boat story, and the LAYC meeting in Santiago, Chile.
*   **Positive Intelligence**: AMCARBON-1 was not particularly valuable as a source of positive intelligence due to his limited long-standing contacts in Latin America.
*   **Assessment**: AMCARBON-1 was considered honest, cooperative, and security-conscious. JMWAVE planned to continue using him in the same manner, believing the relationship enhanced their operational security and minimized media-related difficulties in South Florida.

## Conclusion

These documents collectively illustrate the multifaceted approach of the CIA's operations against Cuba and communist influence in Latin America during the early 1960s. They demonstrate the agency's reliance on a network of assets, ranging from journalists to Cuban exiles, to gather intelligence, disseminate propaganda, and carry out covert actions. The dispatches also reveal the inherent risks and challenges of managing these clandestine networks, including security breaches, agent compromise, and the need for constant vigilance. The information contained within these documents underscores the complex and often morally ambiguous nature of Cold War intelligence operations and their impact on the political landscape of the region.

## Simplified Explanation for Someone Unfamiliar with JFK Files

Imagine these documents as pieces of a puzzle showing how the CIA operated in the early 1960s, especially around Cuba. At that time, the U.S. government was very concerned about the spread of communism, especially after Fidel Castro took power in Cuba. These files give us a peek into the secret world of spies and informants during this period.

**What are these documents about?**

These documents are mostly reports and messages between CIA officers. They talk about:

*   **Informants and Agents:** The CIA used people in Cuba and other countries to gather information. These people had code names like "AMCARBON-1" or "AMFAUNA-25" to keep their identities secret. Some were journalists, others were Cuban exiles, and some were even working within the Cuban government.
*   **Gathering Intelligence:** The CIA wanted to know everything happening in Cuba: troop movements, new weapons, who was loyal to Castro, and what people thought about the revolution.
*   **Spreading Propaganda:** The CIA tried to influence public opinion by planting stories in newspapers and spreading rumors to discredit the Castro regime.
*   **Planning Covert Actions:** The documents hint at plans to support anti-Castro groups, sabotage Cuban infrastructure, and even assassinate key figures.
*   **Exfiltration:** If someone was in danger they needed to be helped out of Cuba.

**Key things to understand:**

*   **Secrecy:** Everything was top secret. The CIA used code names, secret writing, and complicated communication methods to avoid being detected.
*   **Risks:** Being a CIA informant was incredibly dangerous. If caught, they could be imprisoned or killed.
*   **Moral Questions:** Some of the actions described in these documents raise questions about whether the U.S. government was doing the right thing. Was it okay to interfere in another country's affairs? Was it okay to use deception and manipulation to achieve its goals?

**Overall:**

These files show us that the CIA was deeply involved in trying to undermine the Cuban government. They used a network of secret agents, spread propaganda, and considered various covert actions. While the goal was to stop the spread of communism, the methods used were often risky and morally questionable. It's like a spy movie, but these events really happened and had a big impact on the relationship between the U.S. and Cuba.
