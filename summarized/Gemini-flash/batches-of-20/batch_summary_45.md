# Navigating Shadows: CIA and FBI Collaboration in Cold War Espionage

This summary synthesizes multiple FBI documents related to CIA liaison activities during the Cold War era. The documents reveal a complex web of collaboration and information sharing between the two agencies, focusing on individuals, operations, and intelligence gathering related to Cuba, the Soviet Union, and other areas of strategic interest. The overarching narrative highlights the FBI's role in supporting CIA operations through background checks, source development, and monitoring potential threats, while also ensuring that its own domestic intelligence interests are protected.

## I.  Tracking Individuals of Interest: A Focus on Cuba

Several documents center around the investigation and monitoring of individuals with potential links to Cuba, both pre- and post-revolution.

*   **Antonio Hector Rivero Juarrero:** An FBI Airtel dated July 16, 1965, discusses Antonio Hector Rivero Juarrero, a Cuban exile working for a subsidiary of Amadeo Barletta's Enterprises in Santo Domingo. Information from the CIA indicated that Rivero had previously worked for General Motors in Havana under Barletta before exiling himself to Miami after Castro's rise to power. The report describes Rivero as a "boisterous, gregarious type" and a "wheeler dealer" with a reputation for heavy drinking and being motivated by money. Rivero's association with Mitchell Livingston Werbell, who was described by the CIA as a "wild man," led the FBI to cease consideration of Rivero as a potential source.
*   **Eloy Gutierrez Menoyo:** A correlation summary from January 18, 1963, extensively details the activities of Eloy Gutierrez Menoyo, a former leader in the Second Front of the Escambray during the Cuban Revolution. The summary compiles information from various sources, including CIA reports and informants, regarding Menoyo's early support for Castro, his subsequent disillusionment, and his involvement in anti-Castro activities after fleeing to Miami in January 1961. The summary notes Menoyo's complex relationships with other Cuban exiles, his alleged ties to gambling, and conflicting reports about his political leanings (anti-communist, communist).
*   **Jorge Beliard:** An FBI memo from June 26, 1961, discusses Jorge Beliard, a station manager for Cubana Airlines at Idlewild International Airport in New York City. The CIA believed Beliard could be useful in establishing courier routes between the United States and Cuba and requested the FBI's permission to contact him. The FBI considered several options, including refusing CIA access, allowing CIA to proceed independently, or acting as an intermediary. A follow-up Airtel on June 30, 1961, directed the New York office to discreetly assess Beliard's willingness and capability to assist in establishing courier routes without revealing the CIA's involvement.

## II. Covert Operations and Intelligence Gathering

These documents shed light on the clandestine methods employed by the CIA and FBI to gather intelligence and potentially influence events related to Cuba and the Soviet Union.

*   **Petros Moutsos:** A memorandum dated September 14, 1960, reveals a CIA plan to utilize Petros Moutsos, a former informant in the communist-dominated Greek Maritime Organization (OENO), as a source of information in Cuba. The CIA intended to have Moutsos jump ship in New Orleans with the approval of the Immigration and Naturalization Service, travel to Havana under a cover, and attempt to re-establish contact with his estranged wife, Angela Boyer, who had a communist background. The FBI was informed of this plan and instructed not to disseminate this information outside the Bureau.
*   **Levi Laub:** A memo from July 5, 1963, references a CIA letter regarding Levi Laub's unauthorized travel to Cuba between February 22 and March 11, 1963. The information was provided to the CIA by the British Intelligence Service (MI-6), which obtained it from Gavin Young, a British newspaperman who was also in Cuba during that period. MI-6 planned to make Young available to the FBI for an interview.
*   **Enrique Garcia Armenteros:** An FBI memo from October 15, 1963, notes that the CIA had placed a man in Cuba who might be able to develop information in response to a Bureau lead. This highlights the ongoing efforts to gather intelligence from within Cuba.

## III. Counterintelligence and Monitoring Soviet Activities

The documents also highlight the FBI's counterintelligence efforts, including monitoring Soviet activities and assessing potential security risks.

*   **Eduardo Espinosa y Prieto:** A series of documents detail the investigation of Eduardo Espinosa y Prieto, the Mexican Ambassador to Warsaw, and his potential ties to communist activities. The CIA requested the FBI's permission to share information with West German authorities (BfV) regarding Espinosa's alleged financial support of communist workers during his tenure in New York City. The FBI initially objected to this characterization, citing a lack of substantiating evidence. Further documents revealed that Espinosa was suspected of being a Soviet contact and that his wife was reported to have been an agent of the Soviet security services.
*   **Soviet Embassy in Havana:** An FBI memo from November 21, 1960, discusses the shipment of ten safes from the Mosler Safe Company in the United States to the Soviet Embassy in Havana. The FBI provided the CIA with detailed information about the safes, including model numbers, serial numbers, combinations, and keys. This indicates a high level of concern about Soviet activities in Cuba and a proactive approach to monitoring and potentially compromising Soviet communications and information security.

## IV. Balancing Collaboration and Protecting Bureau Interests

The documents reveal the delicate balance the FBI had to maintain between collaborating with the CIA and protecting its own operational interests and sources.

*   **Ismael Rodriguez:** An FBI memo from August 17, 1961, reveals that Ismael Rodriguez, the comptroller of Cubana Airlines in New York City and a source of information for the Bureau, was also being used by the CIA as a courier for transmitting material between the U.S. and Cuba. The FBI directed this information to the Nationalities Intelligence Section, indicating a need to assess the potential impact on its own operations and sources.
*   **Herbert Levy:** An FBI memo from December 11, 1961, discusses Herbert Levy, Director of Central Operations at St. Regis Paper Company, who had previously provided information to the CIA while living in Houston, Texas. Levy contacted the CIA again and expressed a willingness to continue providing information but requested that his identity not be revealed to any other agency or commercial firm. The FBI informed the CIA of Levy's availability while respecting his confidentiality concerns.

## V. Conclusion: A Partnership Forged in Cold War Tensions

These documents paint a picture of a complex and multifaceted relationship between the FBI and the CIA during the Cold War. The two agencies collaborated on a range of activities, including intelligence gathering, counterintelligence, and covert operations, all aimed at containing the spread of communism and protecting U.S. interests. The documents also reveal the inherent tensions in this relationship, as each agency sought to protect its own sources, methods, and operational priorities. The meticulous record-keeping and detailed information sharing underscore the gravity of the situation and the high stakes involved in the Cold War struggle. The individuals mentioned, from Cuban exiles to Soviet diplomats, were all pieces in a larger geopolitical puzzle, and the efforts to track, assess, and potentially exploit them reflect the intense focus on intelligence and counterintelligence that defined this era.

## Explanation for the Uninitiated: Understanding the JFK Files and Cold War Context

Imagine the Cold War as a global chess game between the United States and the Soviet Union. Cuba, a small island nation close to the U.S., became a major pawn after Fidel Castro's revolution turned it communist. This created a crisis for the U.S., as it now had a communist ally of the Soviets right on its doorstep.

The JFK files, released under a law mandating the declassification of documents related to President Kennedy's assassination, offer a peek into the intelligence operations of the time, including those focused on Cuba.

The documents you've read here are like snippets of conversations between the FBI (the internal security and law enforcement agency) and the CIA (the foreign intelligence gathering agency). They show how these agencies worked together, shared information, and sometimes stepped on each other's toes as they tried to understand and counter the threat posed by Cuba.

Here's a breakdown of what the documents reveal:

*   **Spying on People of Interest:** The agencies were interested in anyone who might be involved with Cuba, either for or against the Castro regime. This included Cuban exiles in the U.S., airline employees who traveled between the two countries, and even diplomats from other countries who might have been helping Cuba or the Soviets. The goal was to learn their intentions, connections, and any secrets they might hold.
*   **Secret Operations:** Both the FBI and CIA engaged in secret operations to gather information. This included recruiting informants, planting spies, and using people as couriers to send messages and materials in secret.
*   **Counterintelligence:** The U.S. was also worried about the Soviet Union's influence in Cuba. The documents reveal efforts to track Soviet diplomats, monitor their activities, and even try to break into their safes to steal secrets.
*   **Working Together (and Sometimes Not):** The FBI and CIA were supposed to work together, but the documents show that they sometimes had conflicting interests. Each agency wanted to protect its own sources and methods, and they didn't always agree on the best way to handle a situation.

**Why Does This Matter?**

These documents are important because they give us a glimpse into the hidden world of Cold War espionage. They show the lengths to which the U.S. government went to protect its interests and counter the perceived threat of communism. They also highlight the ethical and practical challenges of intelligence gathering, including the use of informants, the invasion of privacy, and the potential for abuse of power. By understanding these historical operations, we can better understand the complex world of intelligence today. They also may reveal how the Kennedy assassination was or was not related to Cuba.
