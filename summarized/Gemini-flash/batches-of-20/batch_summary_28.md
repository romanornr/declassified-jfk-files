# CIA Operations and Cuban Subversion in the Early 1960s

This summary compiles classified CIA documents from the early 1960s, revealing the agency's multifaceted operations related to Cuba and its influence in Latin America. The documents highlight attempts to gather intelligence, support anti-Castro movements, and counter Cuban subversion, while also navigating complex relationships with allied governments and exile groups.

## Intelligence Gathering and Counter-Subversion Efforts

- **Focus on PCES (El Salvador Communist Party):** The CIA was actively collecting intelligence on the PCES, including its membership, organization, and connections to Moscow. A key asset ("Cuban Target") provided significant information, including the names of PCES Central Committee members such as Shafick Handal, Jorge Arias Gomez, and Raul Castellanos Figueroa.
    - Implication: This intelligence was crucial for understanding the scope of communist influence in El Salvador and potentially disrupting PCES activities.
- **Exploiting Cuban Defectors:** The CIA sought to leverage Cuban defectors for intelligence on Cuban intelligence operations and to potentially target them against Cuban interests.
    - Significance: Defectors could provide valuable insights into Cuban methods and objectives, but their handling required careful consideration of security risks and potential for exposure.
- **Monitoring Roque Dalton:** Roque Dalton, a known POES (Salvadoran Communist Party) member, was under scrutiny due to his disappearance. There were concerns among POES members and students, with some willing to accept his expulsion rather than imprisonment.
    - Implication: Dalton's situation highlights the political tensions and potential for internal conflict within leftist movements in El Salvador.
- **Operation KDAFGHAN:** The CIA was involved in a technical operation, KDAFGHAN, which involved photographic surveillance using specialized lenses and cameras. This operation required significant logistical support, including the procurement of equipment and the renewal of passports for operatives.
    - Implication: KDAFGHAN demonstrates the CIA's sophisticated technical capabilities and its commitment to long-term surveillance operations.

## Collaboration with Latin American Governments

- **Briefing Guatemalan Leadership:** CIA officers briefed Guatemalan leaders, including Chief of State Colonel Peralta, on DGI (Cuban Intelligence Directorate) structure, operational techniques, and aims in Guatemala.
    - Significance: The briefing aimed to foster cooperation and coordination between the CIA and the Guatemalan government in countering Cuban subversion.
- **Peralta's Concerns:** Colonel Peralta expressed strong concerns about the lack of aggressive U.S. action against Cuba, criticizing Mexico for its dealings with Cuba. He advocated for a hard line, including the use of force.
    - Implication: Peralta's views reflect a desire for more decisive action against Cuba and highlight tensions between the U.S. and some Latin American governments regarding Cuba policy.
- **Coordination with Salvadoran Intelligence:** The CIA coordinated with the Salvadoran Intelligence Chief to brief him on the recruitment of the "Cuban Target" and emphasize the importance of security considerations.
    - Significance: This collaboration was essential for protecting the CIA's assets and maintaining operational secrecy.

## Challenges and Risks

- **Security Breaches:** There were concerns about potential security breaches that could damage CIA operations and U.S. relations.
    - Implication: The need for compartmentation and security was paramount to protect sensitive sources and methods.
- **Entrapment Concerns:** The "Cuban Target" expressed concerns about entrapment, highlighting the risks associated with recruiting and handling sensitive sources.
    - Significance: The CIA had to balance the need for intelligence with the safety and well-being of its assets.
- **Dalton's Case:** The handling of Dalton's case involved delicate negotiations with the Salvadoran government, weighing the potential benefits of his cooperation against the risks of his release.
    - Implication: The Dalton situation illustrates the complex political considerations involved in intelligence operations.
- **Potential Exposure of JMWAVE:** There were concerns that individuals like Jorge Gutierrez Ulla and Felipe Rivero might expose JMWAVE activities, revealing combined operations facilities, activities, and personnel.
    - Significance: The CIA took measures to increase vigilance at combined operations sites to mitigate potential damage.

## Christian Democracy in Latin America

- **Analysis of Christian Democratic Parties:** A comprehensive analysis of Christian Democracy in Latin America assessed the movement's current status, potential, and challenges.
    - Key Findings:
        - Christian Democratic parties were considered politically significant in only four countries: Chile, Venezuela, El Salvador, and Peru.
        - The movement faced challenges in reaching the lower social classes and developing a significant worker base.
        - There was a lack of ideological common ground and a propensity to consort with Communist and Marxist groups.
        - Radicalization of party youth wings threatened to push the parent parties further left.
- **Role of ODCA and European Support:** The Organizacion Democrata Cristiana de America (ODCA) contributed little positive direction. European financial support to CD parties was significant, with the Institute for International Solidarity (IIS) and the International Solidarity Foundation (FIS) playing key roles.
    - Significance: The analysis provides insights into the strengths and weaknesses of the Christian Democratic movement and the factors influencing its development.

## Conclusion

These documents paint a picture of the CIA's intensive efforts to understand and counter Cuban subversion in Latin America during the early 1960s. The agency relied on a network of assets, collaborated with allied governments, and employed sophisticated technical capabilities to gather intelligence and disrupt Cuban influence. However, these operations were fraught with challenges, including security risks, political complexities, and the need to navigate diverse ideological currents within Latin American societies. The analysis of Christian Democracy reveals the complexities of supporting non-communist movements and the difficulties in ensuring their alignment with U.S. interests. The findings emphasize the importance of country-specific assessments and tailored operational approaches in addressing the multifaceted challenges of the Cold War in Latin America.

## Clarification for Readers Unfamiliar with the JFK Files

Okay, let's break this down further, especially for someone who's never heard of the JFK files or this topic before. Imagine this like a historical spy thriller playing out in the 1960s, with the Cold War between the US and the Soviet Union as the backdrop. Cuba, a small island nation close to the US, had just become communist under Fidel Castro, making the US very nervous. These documents show the CIA, America's spy agency, trying to deal with that situation.

**What was the CIA trying to do?**

*   **Gather Information:** The CIA needed to know what Cuba and communist groups in Latin America were planning. This meant finding spies ("assets") who could infiltrate these groups and report back.
*   **Stop Communist Influence:** The US didn't want communism to spread in Latin America. These documents reveal strategies to counter Cuban efforts to support communist movements in other countries.
*   **Support Anti-Castro Groups:** The CIA was working with Cuban exiles (people who fled Cuba after Castro took over) to try and weaken or overthrow Castro's government.
*   **Work with Local Governments:** The CIA needed the cooperation of governments in countries like El Salvador and Guatemala to operate effectively. This meant sharing information and coordinating actions.

**Key Things to Understand:**

*   **"PCES" and "POES":** These are communist parties in El Salvador. The CIA was very interested in their activities and members.
*   **"Cuban Defector":** Someone who used to work for the Cuban government or intelligence services but then switched sides to work with the US. These people were valuable sources of information.
*   **"Asset":** A spy or informant working for the CIA.
*   **"JMWAVE":** A CIA station (basically, a CIA office) based in Miami, Florida, that was heavily involved in anti-Castro operations.
*   **"KDAFGHAN":** A codename for a specific CIA project, in this case, a technical surveillance operation involving cameras and photography.
*   **"Christian Democracy":** A political movement in Latin America that was neither communist nor right-wing dictatorship. The US was trying to figure out if these groups could be allies against communism, but some of them were very anti-American.

**What were some of the challenges?**

*   **Keeping secrets:** It was crucial that the CIA's operations remained secret. If the Cubans or their allies found out what the CIA was doing, it could put agents in danger and ruin operations.
*   **Finding reliable people:** Not everyone could be trusted. The CIA had to be careful about who they recruited as assets.
*   **Dealing with different opinions:** Some governments in Latin America wanted the US to be more aggressive against Cuba, while others were more cautious.
*   **Managing Cuban exiles:** The exiles had different goals and ideas about how to overthrow Castro, which made it difficult for the CIA to coordinate their efforts.

**In simple terms,** these documents are a peek behind the curtain of the Cold War, showing the CIA trying to play a complex game of spies and politics in Latin America to stop the spread of communism, particularly from Cuba. It involved gathering secrets, working with local allies, and trying to manage a volatile situation with many different players and agendas.
