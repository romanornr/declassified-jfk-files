# Analysis of CIA Documents Related to the Tarasoff, Swenson, and Oswald Cases

This summary analyzes a collection of classified CIA documents dated between 1960 and 1977, focusing on several distinct but interconnected themes: operational security concerns surrounding CIA employees and their families, the use of cover identities and backstories for clandestine operations, the management and tracking of individuals of interest using the 201 system, and investigations related to Lee Harvey Oswald.

## I. Operational Security and Covert Activities

### A. The Tarasoff Case: Protecting Agency Affiliation

These documents highlight the Agency's meticulous approach to safeguarding its employees' identities and activities. The case of Anna Tarasoff, whose father intended to visit the Russian Embassy to obtain a visa in 1960, illustrates these concerns. Key actions included:

*   **Meeting Coordination:** A special meeting was convened on 13 October 1960, involving representatives from various CIA departments (Security, CI Staff, CI/Projects, CCG/DC, and OCG/OCB) to strategize how to handle the situation.
*   **Cover Story Reinforcement:** Boris D. Tarasoff, Anna's husband and an Agency employee in Mexico, had his "light state cover" as a contract employee of the Department of State, Escort Branch, Division of Language Services, "firmed up."
*   **Retroactive Cover:** A U.S. Army Translation Unit cover was provided for Anna Tarasoff, retroactive to her entry on duty.
*   **Credit Checks:** Expedited credit checks were conducted on both Anna and Boris to ensure they were not recorded as Agency employees.
*   **Strategic Non-Briefing:** It was decided not to specifically brief Anna's father on her CIA employment to avoid potential complications, relying instead on the prepared cover story if questions arose.

This detailed response shows the Agency's concern with even seemingly minor potential exposures and the coordinated effort to maintain operational security. A reinvestigation action from 1966 indicates Boris Tarasoff's file was reviewed, but no action was taken due to his overseas assignment. By 1962, Boris was being used as an interpreter for a Soviet Delegation, operating under State Department cover as a language school contractor. Travel orders and a travel briefing sheet from August 1960 detail Boris's temporary duty (TDY) replacement assignment in Mexico City, emphasizing the "light state cover" and Area Classified Category A designation, reinforcing the need for a comprehensive cover story.

### B. Harold F. Swenson: Alias Documentation and Military Cover

The documents related to Harold F. Swenson detail the creation and maintenance of his alias and cover.

*   **Alias Documentation:** In November 1962, alias documentation was requested for Swenson under the name Harold Francis Safley, including a backstopped driver's license.
*   **Military Cover Backstop:** Documents confirm the establishment of a military cover backstop for Swenson, including blocking records and ensuring an Army W-2 was issued.
*   **Cover Cancellation:** A notification from 1975 indicates the cancellation of Swenson's military cover backstop.

The level of detail, including specific requests for birth certificates and pocket litter to support his legend as an "Industrial Economist," demonstrates the thoroughness of the Agency's cover operations. His contacts were logged, including one Bill Dallgren who was also an employee of CIA/IER.

### C. Alfonso Rudolph Michirich: Covert Interest Investigation

The memo regarding Alfonso Rudolph Michirich details an investigation into an individual of "covert interest." The assignments included:

*   **National Agency Checks:** The FBI, ONI, ACSI, STATE, PASSPORT, CSC, HCUA, OSI, I&N, and MILITARY were all to be checked.
*   **Informant Contact:** Attempting to contact informants in Columbus, Georgia, for employment and police/credit information.

The special instructions note Michirich's locations from 1916 to the present, including periods in the U.S. Army, Washington, D.C., Columbus, Georgia/Panama, and Mexico. References were provided, including Milton C. Franklin and T.H. Hanley.

## II. The 201 System: Tracking Individuals of Interest

### A. Overview of the 201 System

These documents outline the CIA's "201 System," a method for identifying, controlling, and filing information on individuals of specific interest to the Operations Directorate, as described in a 1974 manual.

*   **Purpose:** The system provided a way to track subjects of interest using 201 files, which contained biographical reporting, personal history, and current status.
*   **Components:**
    *   **201 Number:** A unique identifier for each individual.
    *   **201 Dossier:** The official file containing the 201 opening form and all relevant information.
    *   **Master 201 Record:** A machine record that produced a master reference for the Main Index.
    *   **Main Index Master 201 Reference:** A reference printed in response to an Index Search Request.
    *   **OI Code:** A two-letter symbol used to record associations with organizations or activities of interest.
    *   **201 Machine Lists:** Lists generated from the mechanized 201 Index based on identifying information.
*   **Opening a 201 Dossier:** Operational components could open a 201 file in coordination with the Information Services Group (ISG) for individuals meeting specific criteria.
*   **Contents of the Dossier:** Included biographic information, photographs, operational approvals, name check replies, and assessments.
*   **Maintenance Procedures:** Dossiers were maintained in document date order and subject to periodic purging of duplicate or irrelevant material.
*   **Restricted Access:** Access to sensitive 201 files could be restricted, requiring authorization from the restricting desk for access.
*   **Machine Listings:** Provided names and 201 numbers based on geographic or functional areas of interest.

The 201 system ensured that the Agency could efficiently track and manage information on individuals, enabling quick retrieval and analysis of data.

### B. Oliverio Antonio TOMEU Vasallo: An Example of 201 Usage

One document references the 201 system in relation to Oliverio Antonio TOMEU Vasallo (201-283306). This individual was recontacted in June 1964, providing details on individuals related to Jose LLANUSA Sobel. The document reflects the practical application of the 201 system in managing and referencing information obtained from contacts.

## III. Lee Harvey Oswald and Connections to State Department Personnel

### A. Investigation into Oswald's Return from the Soviet Union

A memorandum dated January 29, 1964, discusses the case of Lee Harvey Oswald, focusing on the roles of Abram Chayes and Samuel Wise in Oswald's return to the United States from the Soviet Union in June 1962.

*   **Abram Chayes:** Identified as a Legal Officer of the State Department, Chayes was reportedly responsible for Oswald's return, along with Llewellyn Thompson (then Ambassador to Russia). Chayes had previously been granted security approval for liaison contact with the CIA on covert action matters.
*   **Samuel Wise:** Counsel at the American Embassy in Moscow, Wise advised that Bruce Frederick Davis, a defector similar to Oswald, had not expatriated himself. Wise had been a CIA employment applicant and contract employee on AEACTIVE.

The memo suggests scrutiny of State Department personnel involved in Oswald's case, potentially seeking to understand if there were any connections or irregularities in the handling of his return.

### B. Potential Security Concerns and Associations

The memo raises potential security concerns about Wise, noting his association with William Orville Munsell, who was disapproved for CIA employment due to associations with persons of questionable loyalty. Additionally, Wise attended Scarsdale High School, which was scrutinized for alleged Communist influence. These details suggest an effort to assess Wise's background and potential vulnerabilities.

## IV. James Earl Ray and the Martin Luther King Assassination Investigation

A 1977 message discusses the U.S. House of Representatives Select Committee on Assassinations' investigation into the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. The committee intended to pursue leads in Portugal, the UK, and Mexico related to James Earl Ray.

*   **Committee's Intentions:** The committee planned to establish a "cordial relationship" with Portuguese National Police to access files and interview witnesses.
*   **CIA's Response:** While the CIA was cooperating with the committee, it advised against involving station officers in overt investigations, suggesting that LEGATs (Legal Attach√©s) or others should handle these matters.

This document illustrates the CIA's approach to cooperating with external investigations while protecting its operational assets and methods.

## Conclusion

These documents collectively reveal the CIA's intricate operational methodologies, encompassing robust security protocols, the strategic use of cover identities, and sophisticated information management systems. The Tarasoff and Swenson cases exemplify the Agency's commitment to protecting its personnel and operations through elaborate cover stories and meticulous documentation. The 201 system highlights the Agency's capacity to track and manage information on individuals of interest, ensuring that relevant data could be efficiently accessed and analyzed. The examination of Lee Harvey Oswald's case underscores the Agency's interest in understanding potential connections or irregularities involving State Department personnel. The James Earl Ray document demonstrates how the CIA balanced cooperation with external investigations with the need to safeguard its own operations. Together, these documents provide a glimpse into the complex and multifaceted operations of the CIA during the Cold War era and beyond.

## Making it Understandable for Readers Unfamiliar with JFK Files

Okay, let's break this down further for someone who knows nothing about the JFK files or this specific topic:

**What's This All About?**

These documents are like pieces of a puzzle from the files of the CIA (America's spy agency). They cover a few different, but related, subjects:

*   **Protecting CIA Secrets:** How the CIA kept its employees' identities secret (and sometimes those of their families) and created false backgrounds for them to use while undercover.
*   **Tracking People:** The way the CIA kept track of information on people they were interested in, kind of like a giant filing system for potential spies, informants, or enemies.
*   **Lee Harvey Oswald:** Some information related to the guy who shot President Kennedy and how he came to be back in the United States before the assassination.
*   **Martin Luther King's Assassination:** The CIA's involvement (or lack thereof) in the investigation into who killed Martin Luther King Jr.

**Think of it like this:** You're looking at old memos and reports from inside the CIA.

**Key Things To Understand:**

*   **"Cover":** This means a fake identity or background story that a CIA agent would use to hide what they *really* do. It's like an actor playing a role. The more detailed and believable the cover, the better.
*   **"201 File":** This was a specific way the CIA kept files on people. It was more than just a simple file; it was a structured system for gathering and organizing information on individuals the CIA considered important for any reason. The 201 system was how they found old infomation and filed it on people.
*   **"Backstopping":**  This refers to creating fake supporting documents (like fake driver's licenses, employment records, etc.) to make a cover story more believable. Think of it as providing evidence for your fake identity.
*   **"Operational Security":**  This is the CIA's focus on keeping its secrets safe and preventing anyone from finding out about its operations. The more they can keep operations secret, the more succesful the CIA is.

**The Main Stories:**

1.  **The Tarasoff Family:** This shows how worried the CIA was about protecting its employees' identities. A CIA employee's father wanted to visit the Russian Embassy, and the agency went to extreme lengths to make sure the visit wouldn't reveal the employee's CIA connection. This involved creating fake employment records and even deciding *not* to tell the father the truth!
2.  **Harold Swenson's Fake Life:** The CIA created a whole fake background for this guy, including a fake name and fake documents, so he could operate undercover.
3.  **Oswald's Return:** After Lee Harvey Oswald lived in the Soviet Union, it looks like the CIA was keeping tabs on people at the State Department who helped him return to the U.S. This suggests the CIA wanted to make sure there were no security risks or questionable actions taken when Oswald came back.
4. **James Earl Ray:** The CIA was cooperating with other agencies on the investigation and advised against using CIA officers, instead, suggested using Legal Attaches.

**So What Does It All Mean?**

These documents show the CIA's intense focus on secrecy and control during the Cold War era and later. They highlight the complex and sometimes risky methods the agency used to protect its operations and gather information.

This also means the files are very difficult to understand and it is hard to get to the point of what the files mean.
