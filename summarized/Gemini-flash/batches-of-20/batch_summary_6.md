## Explanation for a Reader Unfamiliar with JFK Files

Imagine the CIA is like a giant company with secret departments and international offices. These documents are like internal memos and emails from one of those international offices—Mexico City—back to headquarters. The time is around December 1963, a very tense period in the Cold War.

Here's a simplified breakdown:

*   **What's going on?** The CIA is trying to gather information about Cuba, the Soviet Union (Russia), and other countries of interest. Mexico City is a good place to do this because it's close to Cuba and has lots of international travelers.

*   **Who are these people?** The documents mention a lot of names, but they fall into a few categories:

    *   **CIA Officers:** People working for the CIA, trying to recruit spies and gather information. People like Winston Scott, Thomas Hazlitt, David Phillips and others.
    *   **Potential Spies (Assets):** Regular citizens (Cubans, Mexicans, Russians, etc.) that the CIA is thinking about using as spies. Some examples were Benito Ruiz Gorilo, Jorge Antonio Abasolo Garcia and others.
    *   **Foreign Officials:** Government employees, diplomats, or intelligence officers from other countries (especially the Soviet Union and Cuba) who are being watched by the CIA.
    *   **Contacts:** Ordinary people like family members, friends and acquaintances of those the CIA is interested in.

*   **What are they doing?** The CIA officers are doing a few key things:

    *   **Recruiting:** Trying to convince regular citizens to become spies.
    *   **Surveillance:** Watching foreign officials and suspected spies.
    *   **Gathering Information:** Collecting any information that might be useful, from travel plans to personal connections.
    *   **Managing Assets:** Overseeing current spies and making sure they're doing their jobs.

*   **What's with all the codes and strange terms?** The CIA uses codes and jargon to keep their activities secret.

    *   **JMWAVE:** The code name for the CIA's operations in Cuba.
    *   **POA (Personal History Check):** A background check on a potential spy.
    *   **201 File:** A file the CIA keeps on someone they are watching or might use as a spy. A way of identifying a person of specific interest to the Operations Directorate and for recording and filing all pertinent information about that person.
    *   **Drug Dip:** Seems to indicate someone who uses drugs.
    *   **OI Code:** A way of categorizing individuals based on their affiliations with organizations or activities of operational interest.
    *   **RYBAT:** A high-priority communication system.

*   **What about the JFK assassination?** These documents are related to the JFK assassination files because the CIA's activities in Mexico City have been the subject of conspiracy theories. These files are being reviewed to see if they contain any information relevant to the assassination.

*   **Important Themes:**
    *   Intelligence Gathering
    *   Recruitment of Assets
    *   Monitoring Soviet and Cuban Activities
    *   Internal Security Procedures
    *   Strict guidelines on who can be used as assets.

In essence, these documents provide a glimpse into the CIA's secret world during the Cold War, with a focus on their efforts to gather intelligence and recruit spies in Mexico City.
